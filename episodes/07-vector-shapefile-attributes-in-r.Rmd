This tutorial explains what shapefile attributes are and how to work with
shapefile attributes in `R`. It also covers how to identify and query shapefile
attributes, as well as subset shapefiles by specific attribute values.
Finally, we will review how to plot a shapefile according to a set of attribute
values.

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes
When we import a shapefile into `R`, the `st_read()` function automatically
stores metadata and attributes associated with the file.

## Load the Data
To work with vector data in `R`, we can use the `sf` package. The `raster`
package also allows us to explore metadata using similar commands for both
raster and vector files.

We will import three shapefiles. The first is our `AOI` or area of
interest boundary polygon that we worked with in
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/open-shapefiles-in-R/).
The second is a shapefile containing the location of roads and trails within the
field site. The third is a file containing the Fisher tower location.

If you completed the
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/open-shapefiles-in-R/)
tutorial, you can skip this code.

```{r load-packages-data }
# load packages
# sf: for vector work
library(sf)
# raster: for raster metadata/attributes
library(raster)

# set working directory to data folder
# setwd("pathToDirHere")

# Import a polygon shapefile
aoi_boundary_HARV <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HarClip_UTMZ18.shp")

# Import a line shapefile
lines_HARV <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARV_roads.shp")

# Import a point shapefile
point_HARV <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARVtower_UTM18N.shp")

```

## Query Shapefile Metadata
Remember, as covered in
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/open-shapefiles-in-R/),
we can view metadata associated with an `R` object using:

* `st_geometry_type()` - Describes the type of vector data stored in the object.
* `nrow()` - How many features are in this spatial object?
* object `st_bbox()` - The spatial extent (geographic area covered by) features
in the object.
* coordinate reference system (`st_crs()`) - The spatial projection that the data are
in.

Let's explore the metadata for our `point_HARV` object.

```{r view-shapefile-metadata }
# view geometry type
st_geometry_type(point_HARV)

# x= isn't actually needed; it just specifies which object
# view features count
nrow(point_HARV)

# view crs - note - this only works with the raster package loaded
st_crs(point_HARV)

# view extent- note - this only works with the raster package loaded
st_bbox(point_HARV)

# view metadata summary
point_HARV
```

## About Shapefile Attributes
Shapefiles often contain an associated database or spreadsheet of values called
**attributes** that describe the vector features in the shapefile. You can think
of this like a spreadsheet with rows and columns. Each column in the spreadsheet
is an individual **attribute** that describes an object. Shapefile attributes
include measurements that correspond to the geometry of the shapefile features.

For example, the `HARV_Roads` shapefile (`lines_HARV` object) contains an
attribute called `TYPE`. Each line in the shapefile has an associated `TYPE`
which describes the type of road (woods road, footpath, boardwalk, or
stone wall).

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/dc-spatial-vector/Attribute_Table.png"></a>
    <figcaption>The shapefile format allows us to store attributes for each
    feature (vector object) stored in the shapefile. The attribute table, is
    similar to a spreadsheet. There is a row for each feature. The first column
    contains the unique ID of the feature. We can add additional columns that
    describe the feature. Image Source: National Ecological Observatory Network
    (NEON)
    </figcaption>
</figure>


We can look at all of the associated data attributes by printing the contents of the `sf` object. We can use the `ncol` function to count the number of attributes associated with a spatial object too.

```{r shapefile-attributes}
# how many attributes are in our vector data object?
ncol(lines_HARV)
```

We can view the individual **name of each attribute** using the
`names` method in `R`. We could also view just the first 6 rows
of attribute values using `head(lines_HARV)`.

Let's give it a try.

```{r view-shapefile-attributes }
# view just the attribute names for the lines_HARV spatial object
names(lines_HARV)

# just view the attributes & first 6 attribute values of the data
head(lines_HARV)
```

## Explore Values within One Attribute
We can explore individual values stored within a particular attribute.
Again, comparing attributes to a spreadsheet or a `data.frame`, this is similar
to exploring values in a column. We can do this using the `$` and the name of
the attribute: `objectName$attributeName`.

```{r explore-attribute-values }
# view all attributes in the lines shapefile within the TYPE field
lines_HARV$TYPE

# view unique values within the "TYPE" attributes
levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)

```

Notice that two of our TYPE attribute values consist of two separate words:
stone wall and woods road. There are really four unique TYPE values, not six
TYPE values.

### Subset Shapefiles
We can use the `objectName$attributeName` syntax to select a subset of features
from a spatial object in `R`.

```{r Subsetting-shapefiles}
# select features that are of TYPE "footpath"
# could put this code into other function to only have that function work on
# "footpath" lines
lines_HARV[lines_HARV$TYPE == "footpath",]

# save an object with only footpath lines
footpath_HARV <- lines_HARV[lines_HARV$TYPE == "footpath",]
footpath_HARV

# how many features are in our new object
nrow(footpath_HARV)
```

Our subsetting operation reduces the `features` count from 13 to 2. This means
that only two feature lines in our spatial object have the attribute
"TYPE=footpath".

We can plot our subsetted shapefiles.

```{r plot-subset-shapefile}
# plot just footpaths
plot(footpath_HARV$geometry,
     lwd = 6,
     main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Footpaths")

```

Interesting. Above, it appeared as if we had 2 features in our footpaths subset.
Why does the plot look like there is only one feature?

Let's adjust the colors used in our plot. If we have 2 features in our vector
object, we can plot each using a unique color by assigning unique colors (`col=`)
to our features. We use the syntax

`col = "c("colorOne", "colorTwo")`

to do this.

```{r plot-subset-shapefile-unique-colors }
# plot just footpaths
plot(footpath_HARV$geometry,
     col = c("green", "blue"), # set color for each feature
     lwd = 6,
     main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Footpaths \n Feature one = blue, Feature two= green")

```

Now, we see that there are in fact two features in our plot!

## Plot Lines by Attribute Value
To plot vector data with the color determined by a set of attribute values, the attribute values must be class = `factor`. A **factor** is similar to a category you can group vector objects by a particular category value for example you can group all lines of `TYPE=footpath`. However, in `R`, a factor can also have a determined *order*.

By default, `R` will import spatial object attributes as `factors`.

> ## Data Tip
> If our data attribute values are not
> read in as factors, we can convert the categorical
> attribute values using `as.factor()`.
{: .callout}

```{r convert-to-factor }
# view the original class of the TYPE column
class(lines_HARV$TYPE)

# view levels or categories - note that there are no categories yet in our data!
# the attributes are just read as a list of character elements.
levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)

# Convert the TYPE attribute into a factor
# Only do this IF the data do not import as a factor!
# lines_HARV$TYPE <- as.factor(lines_HARV$TYPE)
# class(lines_HARV$TYPE)
# levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)

# how many features are in each category or level?
summary(lines_HARV$TYPE)
```

When we use `plot()`, we can specify the colors to use for each attribute using
the `col=` element. To ensure that `R` renders each feature by it's associated
factor / attribute value, we need to create a `vector` or colors - one for each
feature, according to it's associated attribute value / `factor` value.

To create this vector we can use the following syntax:

`c("colorOne", "colorTwo", "colorThree")[object$factor]`

Note in the above example we have

1. a vector of colors - one for each factor value (unique attribute value)
2. the attribute itself (`[object$factor]`) of class `factor`.

Let's give this a try.


``` {r palette-and-plot}
# Check the class of the attribute - is it a factor?
class(lines_HARV$TYPE)

# how many "levels" or unique values does hte factor have?
# view factor values
levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)
# count the number of unique values or levels
length(levels(lines_HARV$TYPE))

# create a color palette of 4 colors - one for each factor level
roadPalette <- c("blue", "green", "grey", "purple")
roadPalette
# create a vector of colors - one for each feature in our vector object
# according to its attribute value
roadColors <- c("blue", "green", "grey", "purple")[lines_HARV$TYPE]
roadColors

# plot the lines data, apply a diff color to each factor level)
plot(lines_HARV$geometry,
     col=roadColors,
     lwd = 3,
     main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails")
```

### Adjust Line Width
We can also adjust the width of our plot lines using `lwd`. We can set all lines
to be thicker or thinner using `lwd = `.

```{r adjust-line-width}
# make all lines thicker
plot(lines_HARV$geometry,
     col=roadColors,
     main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails\n All Lines Thickness=6",
     lwd = 6)
```

### Adjust Line Width by Attribute

If we want a unique line width for each factor level or attribute category
in our spatial object, we can use the same syntax that we used for colors, above.

`lwd = c("widthOne", "widthTwo", "widthThree")[object$factor]`

Note that this requires the attribute to be of class `factor`. Let's give it a
try.

```{r line-width-unique }
class(lines_HARV$TYPE)
levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)
# create vector of line widths
lineWidths <- (c(1, 2, 3, 4))[lines_HARV$TYPE]
# adjust line width by level
# in this case, boardwalk (the first level) is the narrowest.
plot(lines_HARV$geometry,
     col=roadColors,
     main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails \n Line width varies by TYPE Attribute Value",
     lwd = lineWidths)
```

> ## Challenge: Plot Line Width by Attribute
> 
> We can customize the width of each line, according to specific attribute value,
> too. To do this, we create a vector of line width values, and map that vector

## Add Plot Legend
We can add a legend to our plot too. When we add a legend, we use the following
elements to specify labels and colors:

* `bottomright`: We specify the **location** of our legend by using a default
keyword. We could also use `top`, `topright`, etc.
* `levels(objectName$attributeName)`: Label the **legend elements** using the
categories of `levels` in an attribute (e.g., levels(lines_HARV$TYPE) means use
the levels boardwalk, footpath, etc).
* `fill=`: apply unique **colors** to the boxes in our legend. `palette()` is
the default set of colors that `R` applies to all plots.

Let's add a legend to our plot.

```{r add-legend-to-plot }
plot(lines_HARV$geometry,
     col=roadColors,
     main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails\n Default Legend")

# we can use the color object that we created above to color the legend objects
roadPalette

# add a legend to our map
legend("bottomright",   # location of legend
      legend=levels(lines_HARV$TYPE), # categories or elements to render in
			 # the legend
      fill=roadPalette) # color palette to use to fill objects in legend.

```

We can tweak the appearance of our legend too.

* `bty=n`: turn off the legend BORDER
* `cex`: change the font size

Let's try it out.

```{r modify-legend-plot }

plot(lines_HARV$geometry,
     col=roadColors,
     main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails \n Modified Legend")
# add a legend to our map
legend("bottomright",
       legend=levels(lines_HARV$TYPE),
       fill=roadPalette,
       bty = "n", # turn off the legend border
       cex = .8) # decrease the font / legend size

```

We can modify the colors used to plot our lines by creating a new color vector,
directly in the plot code too rather than creating a separate object.

`col=(newColors)[lines_HARV$TYPE]`

Let's try it!

```{r plot-different-colors}

# manually set the colors for the plot!
newColors <- c("springgreen", "blue", "magenta", "orange")
newColors

# plot using new colors
plot(lines_HARV$geometry,
     col=(newColors)[lines_HARV$TYPE],
     main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails \n Pretty Colors")

# add a legend to our map
legend("bottomright",
       levels(lines_HARV$TYPE),
       fill=newColors,
       bty = "n", cex = .8)

```
