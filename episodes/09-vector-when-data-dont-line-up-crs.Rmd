{: .prereq}

In [an earlier episode]({{ site.baseurl }}/03-raster-reproject-in-r/)
we learned how to handle a situation where you have two different
files with raster data in different projections. Now we will apply
those same principles to working with vector data.
We will create a base map of our study site using United States
state and country boundary information accessed from the
[United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_state.html).
We will learn how to map vector data that are in different CRSs and thus
don't line up on a map.

We will continue to work with the three shapefiles that we loaded in the
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/06-vector-open-shapefile-in-r/) episode.

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# learners will have this data loaded from previous episodes
aoi_boundary_HARV <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HarClip_UTMZ18.shp")
lines_HARV <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARV_roads.shp")
point_HARV <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARVtower_UTM18N.shp")
CHM_HARV <- raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif")
CHM_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_HARV, xy = TRUE)
roadColors <- c("blue", "green", "grey", "purple")[lines_HARV$TYPE]
```

## Working With Spatial Data From Different Sources

We often need to gather spatial datasets from
different sources and/or data that cover different spatial extents.
These data are often in
different Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs).

Some reasons for data being in different CRSs include:

1. The data are stored in a particular CRS convention used by the data
provider (for example, a government agency).
2. The data are stored in a particular CRS that is customized to a region.
For instance, many states in the US prefer to use a State Plane projection customized
for that state.

![Maps of the United States using data in different projections. Source: opennews.org, from: https://media.opennews.org/cache/06/37/0637aa2541b31f526ad44f7cb2db7b6c.jpg](../images/map_usa_different_projections.jpg)

Notice the differences in shape associated with each different
projection. These differences are a direct result of the calculations
used to "flatten" the data onto a 2-dimensional map. Often data are
stored purposefully in a particular projection that optimizes the
relative shape and size of surrounding geographic boundaries (states,
counties, countries, etc).

In this episode we will learn how to identify and manage spatial data
in different projections. We will learn how to reproject the data so
that they
are in the same projection to support plotting / mapping. Note that
these skills
are also required for any geoprocessing / spatial analysis. Data need
to be in
the same CRS to ensure accurate results.

We will continue to use the `sf` and `raster` packages in this episode.

## Import US Boundaries - Census Data

There are many good sources of boundary base layers that we can use to create a
basemap. Some R packages even have these base layers built in to support quick
and efficient mapping. In this episode, we will use boundary layers for the contiguous
United States, provided by the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_state.html).
It is useful to have shapefiles to work with because we can add
additional attributes to them if need be - for project specific
mapping.

## Read US Boundary File

We will use the `st_read()` function to import the
`/US-Boundary-Layers/US-State-Boundaries-Census-2014` layer into R. This layer
contains the boundaries of all contiguous states in the U.S. Please note that
these data have been modified and reprojected from the original data downloaded
from the Census website to support the learning goals of this episode.

```{r read-shp }
state_boundary_US <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers/US-State-Boundaries-Census-2014.shp")
```

Next, let's plot the U.S. states data:

```{r find-coordinates }
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = state_boundary_US) +
  ggtitle("Map of Contiguous US State Boundaries") +
  coord_sf()
```

## U.S. Boundary Layer

We can add a boundary layer of the United States to our map - to make it look
nicer. We will import
`NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers/US-Boundary-Dissolved-States`.

```{r}
country_boundary_US <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers/US-Boundary-Dissolved-States.shp")
```

If we specify a thicker line width using `size = 2` for the border layer, it will
make our map pop! We will also manually set the colors of the state boundaries
and country boundaries.

```{r us-boundaries-thickness}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = country_boundary_US, color = "gray18", size = 2) +
  geom_sf(data = state_boundary_US, color = "gray40") +
  ggtitle("Map of Contiguous US State Boundaries") +
  coord_sf()
```

Next, let's add the location of a flux tower where our study area is.
As we are adding these layers, take note of the CRS of each object.
First let's look at the CRS of our tower location object:

```{r crs-sleuthing-1}
st_crs(point_HARV)
```

Our project string for `DSM_HARV` specifies the UTM projection as follows:

`+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0`

* **proj=utm:** the projection is UTM, UTM has several zones.
* **zone=18:** the zone is 18
* **datum=WGS84:** the datum WGS84 (the datum refers to the  0,0 reference for
the coordinate system used in the projection)
* **units=m:** the units for the coordinates are in METERS.
* **ellps=WGS84:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's  roundness is calculated) for
the data is WGS84

Note that the `zone` is unique to the UTM projection. Not all CRSs
will have a
zone.

Let's check the CRS of our state and country boundary objects:

```{r crs-sleuthing-2}
st_crs(state_boundary_US)
st_crs(country_boundary_US)
```

Our project string for `state_boundary_US` and `country_boundary_US` specifies
the lat/long projection as follows:

`+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0`

* **proj=longlat:** the data are in a geographic (latitude and longitude)
coordinate system
* **datum=WGS84:** the datum WGS84 (the datum refers to the  0,0 reference for
the coordinate system used in the projection)
* **ellps=WGS84:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's roundness is calculated)
is WGS84

Note that there are no specified units above. This is because this geographic
coordinate reference system is in latitude and longitude which is most
often recorded in decimal degrees.

> ## Data Tip
> the last portion of each `proj4` string
> is `+towgs84=0,0,0 `. This is a conversion factor that is used if a datum
> conversion is required. We will not deal with datums in this episode series.

## CRS Units - View Object Extent

Next, let's view the extent or spatial coverage for the `point_HARV` spatial
object compared to the `state_boundary_US` object.

First we'll look at the extent for our study site:

```{r view-extent-1}
st_bbox(point_HARV)
```

And then the extent for the state boundary data.

```{r view-extent-2}
st_bbox(state_boundary_US)
```

Note the difference in the units for each object. The extent for
`state_boundary_US` is in latitude and longitude which yields smaller numbers
representing decimal degree units. Our tower location point is in UTM, is
represented in meters.

## Reproject Vector Data or No?

We saw in [an earlier episode]({{ site.baseurl }}/03-raster-reproject-in-r/) that when working with raster
data in different CRSs, we needed to convert all objects to the same
CRS. We can do the same thing with our vector data - however, we
don't need to! When using the `ggplot2` package, `ggplot`
automatically converts all objects to the same CRS before plotting.
This means we can plot our three data sets together
without doing any conversion:

```{r layer-point-on-states}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = country_boundary_US, size = 2, color = "gray18") +
  geom_sf(data = state_boundary_US, color = "gray40") +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV, shape = 19, color = "purple") +
  ggtitle("Map of Contiguous US State Boundaries") +
  coord_sf()
```
