We often want to combine values of and perform calculations on rasters to create
a new output raster. This tutorial covers how to subtract one raster from
another using basic raster math and the `overlay()` function. It also covers how
to extract pixel values from a set of locations - for example a buffer region
around plot locations at a field site.

## Raster Calculations in R
We often want to perform calculations on two or more rasters to create a new
output raster. For example, if we are interested in mapping the heights of trees
across an entire field site, we might want to calculate the *difference* between
the Digital Surface Model (DSM, tops of trees) and the
Digital Terrain Model (DTM, ground level). The resulting dataset is referred to
as a Canopy Height Model (CHM) and represents the actual height of trees,
buildings, etc. with the influence of ground elevation removed.

What is a CHM, DSM and DTM? About Gridded, Raster LiDAR Data</a>.

### Load the Data
We will need the `raster` package to import and perform raster calculations. We
will use the DTM (`NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif`)
and DSM (`NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif`) from the
NEON Harvard Forest Field site.

```{r load-libraries }
# load raster package
library(raster)
library(rgdal)

# view info about the dtm & dsm raster data that we will work with.
GDALinfo("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")
GDALinfo("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

```

As seen from the `geoTiff` tags, both rasters have:

* the same CRS,
* the same resolution
* defined minimum and maximum values.

Let's load the data.

``` {r load-plot-data}
# load the DTM & DSM rasters
DTM_HARV <- raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")
DSM_HARV <- raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

# create a quick plot of each to see what we're dealing with
plot(DTM_HARV,
     main = "Digital Terrain Model \n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")

plot(DSM_HARV,
     main = "Digital Surface Model \n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

## Two Ways to Perform Raster Calculations

We can calculate the difference between two rasters in two different ways:

* by directly subtracting the two rasters in `R` using raster math

or for more efficient processing - particularly if our rasters are large and/or
the calculations we are performing are complex:

* using the `overlay()` function.

## Raster Math & Canopy Height Models
We can perform raster calculations by simply subtracting (or adding,
multiplying, etc) two rasters. In the geospatial world, we call this
"raster math".

Let's subtract the DTM from the DSM to create a Canopy Height Model.

```{r raster-math }
# Raster math example
CHM_HARV <- DSM_HARV - DTM_HARV

# plot the output CHM
plot(CHM_HARV,
     main = "Canopy Height Model - Raster Math Subtract\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
     axes = FALSE)

```

Let's have a look at the distribution of values in our newly created
Canopy Height Model (CHM).

```{r create-hist }
# histogram of CHM_HARV
hist(CHM_HARV,
  col = "springgreen4",
  main = "Histogram of Canopy Height Model\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
  ylab = "Number of Pixels",
  xlab = "Tree Height (m) ")

```

Notice that the range of values for the output CHM is between 0 and 30 meters.
Does this make sense for trees in Harvard Forest?

## Efficient Raster Calculations: Overlay Function
Raster math, like we just did, is an appropriate approach to raster calculations
if:

1. The rasters we are using are small in size.
2. The calculations we are performing are simple.

However, raster math is a less efficient approach as computation becomes more
complex or as file sizes become large.
The `overlay()` function is more efficient when:

1. The rasters we are using are larger in size.
2. The rasters are stored as individual files.
3. The computations performed are complex.

The `overlay()` function takes two or more rasters and applies a function to
them using efficient processing methods. The syntax is

`outputRaster <- overlay(raster1, raster2, fun=functionName)`

> ## Data Tip
> If the rasters are stacked and stored
> as `RasterStack` or `RasterBrick` objects in `R`, then we should use `calc()`.
> `overlay()` will not work on stacked rasters.
{: .callout}

Let's perform the same subtraction calculation that we calculated above using
raster math, using the `overlay()` function.

```{r raster-overlay }
CHM_ov_HARV<- overlay(DSM_HARV,
                      DTM_HARV,
                      fun=function(r1, r2){return(r1-r2)})

plot(CHM_ov_HARV,
  main = "Canopy Height Model - Overlay Subtract\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

How do the plots of the CHM created with manual raster math and the `overlay()`
function compare?

> ## Data Tip
> A custom function consists of a defined
> set of commands performed on a input object. Custom functions are particularly
> useful for tasks that need to be repeated over and over in the code. A
> simplified syntax for writing a custom function in R is:
> `functionName <- function(variable1, variable2){WhatYouWantDone, WhatToReturn}`
{: .callout}

## Export a GeoTIFF
Now that we've created a new raster, let's export the data as a `GeoTIFF` using
the `writeRaster()` function.

When we write this raster object to a `GeoTIFF` file we'll name it
`chm_HARV.tiff`. This name allows us to quickly remember both what the data
contains (CHM data) and for where (HARVard Forest). The `writeRaster()` function
by default writes the output file to your working directory unless you specify a
full file path.

```{r write-raster, eval=FALSE}
# export CHM object to new GeotIFF
writeRaster(CHM_ov_HARV, "chm_HARV.tiff",
            format="GTiff",  # specify output format - GeoTIFF
            overwrite=TRUE, # CAUTION: if this is true, it will overwrite an
                            # existing file
            NAflag=-9999) # set no data value to -9999

```

### writeRaster Options
The function arguments that we used above include:

* **format:** specify that the format will be `GTiff` or `GeoTiff`.
* **overwrite:** If TRUE, `R` will overwrite any existing file  with the same
name in the specified directory. USE THIS SETTING WITH CAUTION!
* **NAflag:** set the `geotiff` tag for `NoDataValue` to -9999, the National
Ecological Observatory Network's (NEON) standard `NoDataValue`.

What do these two histograms tell us about the vegetation structure at Harvard
and SJER?
