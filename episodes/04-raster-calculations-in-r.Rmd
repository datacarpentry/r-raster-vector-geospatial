## Things You'll Need To Complete This Episode

See the [lesson homepage](.) for detailed information about the software,
data, and other prerequisites you will need to work through the examples in 
this episode.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We often want to combine values of and perform calculations on rasters to 
create a new output raster. This episode covers how to subtract one raster from
another using basic raster math and the `lapp()` function. It also covers 
how to extract pixel values from a set of locations - for example a buffer 
region around plot locations at a field site.

## Raster Calculations in R

We often want to perform calculations on two or more rasters to create a new
output raster. For example, if we are interested in mapping the heights of 
trees across an entire field site, we might want to calculate the difference 
between the Digital Surface Model (DSM, tops of trees) and the Digital Terrain 
Model (DTM, ground level). The resulting dataset is referred to as a Canopy 
Height Model (CHM) and represents the actual height of trees, buildings, etc. 
with the influence of ground elevation removed.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Load the Data

For this episode, we will use the DTM and DSM from the NEON Harvard Forest 
Field site and San Joaquin Experimental Range, which we already have loaded 
from previous episodes.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise

Use the `describe()` function to view information about the DTM and DSM data 
files. Do the two rasters have the same or different CRSs and resolutions? Do 
they both have defined minimum and maximum values?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```{r}
describe("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")
describe("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We've already loaded and worked with these two data files in
earlier episodes. Let's plot them each once more to remind ourselves
what this data looks like. First we'll plot the DTM elevation data:

```{r harv-dtm-plot}
 ggplot() +
      geom_raster(data = DTM_HARV_df , 
              aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_dtmCrop)) +
     scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
     coord_quickmap()
```

And then the DSM elevation data:

```{r harv-dsm-plot}
 ggplot() +
      geom_raster(data = DSM_HARV_df , 
              aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_dsmCrop)) +
     scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
     coord_quickmap()
```

## Two Ways to Perform Raster Calculations

We can calculate the difference between two rasters in two different ways:

- by directly subtracting the two rasters in R using raster math

or for more efficient processing - particularly if our rasters are large and/or
the calculations we are performing are complex:

- using the `lapp()` function.

## Raster Math \& Canopy Height Models

We can perform raster calculations by subtracting (or adding,
multiplying, etc) two rasters. In the geospatial world, we call this
"raster math".

Let's subtract the DTM from the DSM to create a Canopy Height Model.
After subtracting, let's create a dataframe so we can plot with `ggplot`.

```{r raster-math}
CHM_HARV <- DSM_HARV - DTM_HARV

CHM_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_HARV, xy = TRUE)
```

We can now plot the output CHM.

```{r harv-chm-plot}
 ggplot() +
   geom_raster(data = CHM_HARV_df , 
               aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_dsmCrop)) + 
   scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
   coord_quickmap()
```

Let's have a look at the distribution of values in our newly created
Canopy Height Model (CHM).

```{r create-hist}
ggplot(CHM_HARV_df) +
    geom_histogram(aes(HARV_dsmCrop))
```

Notice that the range of values for the output CHM is between 0 and 30 meters. 
Does this make sense for trees in Harvard Forest?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge: Explore CHM Raster Values

It's often a good idea to explore the range of values in a raster dataset just 
like we might explore a dataset that we collected in the field.

1. What is the min and maximum value for the Harvard Forest Canopy Height Model (`CHM_HARV`) that we just created?
2. What are two ways you can check this range of data for `CHM_HARV`?
3. What is the distribution of all the pixel values in the CHM?
4. Plot a histogram with 6 bins instead of the default and change the color of the histogram.
5. Plot the `CHM_HARV` raster using breaks that make sense for the data. Include an appropriate color palette for the data, plot title and no axes ticks / labels.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Answers

1) There are missing values in our data, so we need to specify
  `na.rm = TRUE`.

```{r}
min(CHM_HARV_df$HARV_dsmCrop, na.rm = TRUE)
max(CHM_HARV_df$HARV_dsmCrop, na.rm = TRUE)
```

2) Possible ways include:

- Create a histogram
- Use the `min()`, `max()`, and `range()` functions.
- Print the object and look at the `values` attribute.

3) 
```{r chm-harv-hist}
ggplot(CHM_HARV_df) +
    geom_histogram(aes(HARV_dsmCrop))
```

4) 
```{r chm-harv-hist-green}
ggplot(CHM_HARV_df) +
    geom_histogram(aes(HARV_dsmCrop), colour="black", 
                   fill="darkgreen", bins = 6)
```

5) 
```{r chm-harv-raster}
custom_bins <- c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40)
CHM_HARV_df <- CHM_HARV_df %>%
                  mutate(canopy_discrete = cut(HARV_dsmCrop, 
                                               breaks = custom_bins))

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = CHM_HARV_df , aes(x = x, y = y,
                                       fill = canopy_discrete)) + 
     scale_fill_manual(values = terrain.colors(4)) + 
     coord_quickmap()
```

## Efficient Raster Calculations

Raster math, like we just did, is an appropriate approach to raster calculations
if:

1. The rasters we are using are small in size.
2. The calculations we are performing are simple.

However, raster math is a less efficient approach as computation becomes more
complex or as file sizes become large.

The `lapp()` function takes two or more rasters and applies a function to
them using efficient processing methods. The syntax is

`outputRaster <- lapp(x, fun=functionName)`

In which raster can be either a SpatRaster or a SpatRasterDataset which is an 
object that holds rasters. See `help(sds)`. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Data Tip

To create a SpatRasterDataset, we call the function `sds` which can take a list 
of raster objects (each one created by calling `rast`).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Let's perform the same subtraction calculation that we calculated above using
raster math, using the `lapp()` function.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Data Tip

A custom function consists of a defined set of commands performed on a input 
object. Custom functions are particularly useful for tasks that need to be 
repeated over and over in the code. A simplified syntax for writing a custom 
function in R is:
`function_name <- function(variable1, variable2) { WhatYouWantDone, WhatToReturn}`


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r raster-overlay}
CHM_ov_HARV <- lapp(sds(list(DSM_HARV, DTM_HARV)), 
                    fun = function(r1, r2) { return( r1 - r2) })
```

Next we need to convert our new object to a data frame for plotting with
`ggplot`.

```{r}
CHM_ov_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_ov_HARV, xy = TRUE)
```

Now we can plot the CHM:

```{r harv-chm-overlay}
 ggplot() +
   geom_raster(data = CHM_ov_HARV_df, 
               aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_dsmCrop)) + 
   scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
   coord_quickmap()
```

How do the plots of the CHM created with manual raster math and the `lapp()`
function compare?

## Export a GeoTIFF

Now that we've created a new raster, let's export the data as a GeoTIFF
file using
the `writeRaster()` function.

When we write this raster object to a GeoTIFF file we'll name it
`CHM_HARV.tiff`. This name allows us to quickly remember both what the data
contains (CHM data) and for where (HARVard Forest). The `writeRaster()` function
by default writes the output file to your working directory unless you specify a
full file path.

We will specify the output format ("GTiff"), the no data value `NAflag = -9999`. 
We will also tell R to overwrite any data that is already in a file of the same 
name.

```{r write-raster, eval=FALSE}
writeRaster(CHM_ov_HARV, "CHM_HARV.tiff",
            filetype="GTiff",
            overwrite=TRUE,
            NAflag=-9999)
```

### writeRaster() Options

The function arguments that we used above include:

- **filetype:** specify that the format will be `GTiff` or GeoTIFF.
- **overwrite:** If TRUE, R will overwrite any existing file  with the same
  name in the specified directory. USE THIS SETTING WITH CAUTION!
- **NAflag:** set the GeoTIFF tag for `NoDataValue` to -9999, the National
  Ecological Observatory Network's (NEON) standard `NoDataValue`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge: Explore the NEON San Joaquin Experimental Range Field Site

Data are often more interesting and powerful when we compare them across 
various locations. Let's compare some data collected over Harvard Forest to 
data collected in Southern California. The
[NEON San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) field site](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER)
located in Southern California has a very different ecosystem and climate than
the
[NEON Harvard Forest Field Site](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV)
in Massachusetts.

Import the SJER DSM and DTM raster files and create a Canopy Height Model.
Then compare the two sites. Be sure to name your R objects and outputs
carefully, as follows: objectType\_SJER (e.g. `DSM_SJER`). This will help you
keep track of data from different sites!

0. You should have the DSM and DTM data for the SJER site already
  loaded from the
  [Plot Raster Data in R](02-raster-plot.html)
  episode. Don't forget to check the CRSs and units of the data.
1. Create a CHM from the two raster layers and check to make sure the data
  are what you expect.
2. Plot the CHM from SJER.
3. Export the SJER CHM as a GeoTIFF.
4. Compare the vegetation structure of the Harvard Forest and San Joaquin
  Experimental Range.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Answers

1) Use the `lapp()` function to subtract the two rasters \& create the CHM.

```{r}
CHM_ov_SJER <- lapp(sds(list(DSM_SJER, DTM_SJER)),
                       fun = function(r1, r2){ return(r1 - r2) })
```

Convert the output to a dataframe:

```{r}
CHM_ov_SJER_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_ov_SJER, xy = TRUE)
```

Create a histogram to check that the data distribution makes sense:

```{r sjer-chm-overlay-hist}
ggplot(CHM_ov_SJER_df) +
    geom_histogram(aes(SJER_dsmCrop))
```

2) Create a plot of the CHM:

```{r sjer-chm-overlay-raster}
 ggplot() +
      geom_raster(data = CHM_ov_SJER_df, 
              aes(x = x, y = y, 
                   fill = SJER_dsmCrop)
              ) + 
     scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", 
        colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
     coord_quickmap()
```

3) Export the CHM object to a file:

```{r}
writeRaster(CHM_ov_SJER, "chm_ov_SJER.tiff",
            filetype = "GTiff",
            overwrite = TRUE,
            NAflag = -9999)
```

4) Compare the SJER and HARV CHMs.
  Tree heights are much shorter in SJER. You can confirm this by
  looking at the histograms of the two CHMs.

```{r compare-chm-harv-sjer}
ggplot(CHM_HARV_df) +
    geom_histogram(aes(HARV_dsmCrop))

ggplot(CHM_ov_SJER_df) +
    geom_histogram(aes(SJER_dsmCrop))
```
