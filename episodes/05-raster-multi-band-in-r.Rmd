## Things You'll Need To Complete This Episode

See the [lesson homepage](.) for detailed information about the software, data, 
and other prerequisites you will need to work through the examples in this 
episode.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We introduced multi-band raster data in
[an earlier episode](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/01-intro-raster-data). 
This episode explores how to import and plot a multi-band raster in R.

## Getting Started with Multi-Band Data in R

In this episode, the multi-band data that we are working with is imagery 
collected using the
[NEON Airborne Observation Platform](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing)
high resolution camera over the
[NEON Harvard Forest field site](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV).
Each RGB image is a 3-band raster. The same steps would apply to working with a 
multi-spectral image with 4 or more bands - like Landsat imagery.

By using the `rast()` function along with the `lyrs` parameter, we can read 
specific raster bands (i.e. the first one); omitting this parameter would read 
instead all bands.

```{r read-single-band}
RGB_band1_HARV <- 
  rast("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif", 
       lyrs = 1)
```

We need to convert this data to a data frame in order to plot it with `ggplot`.

```{r}
RGB_band1_HARV_df  <- as.data.frame(RGB_band1_HARV, xy = TRUE)
```

```{r harv-rgb-band1}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = RGB_band1_HARV_df,
              aes(x = x, y = y, alpha = HARV_RGB_Ortho_1)) + 
  coord_quickmap()
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge

View the attributes of this band. What are its dimensions, CRS, resolution, min 
and max values, and band number?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```{r}
RGB_band1_HARV
```

Notice that when we look at the attributes of this band, we see:
`dimensions  : 2317, 3073, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)` 

This is R telling us that we read only one its bands.

## Data Tip

The number of bands associated with a raster's file can also be determined 
using the `describe()` function: syntax is `describe(sources(RGB_band1_HARV))`.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Image Raster Data Values

As we saw in the previous exercise, this raster contains values between 0 and 
255. These values represent degrees of brightness associated with the image 
band. In the case of a RGB image (red, green and blue), band 1 is the red band. 
When we plot the red band, larger numbers (towards 255) represent pixels with 
more red in them (a strong red reflection). Smaller numbers (towards 0) 
represent pixels with less red in them (less red was reflected). To plot an RGB 
image, we mix red + green + blue values into one single color to create a full 
color image - similar to the color image a digital camera creates.

### Import A Specific Band

We can use the `rast()` function to import specific bands in our raster object
by specifying which band we want with `lyrs = N` (N represents the band number we
want to work with). To import the green band, we would use `lyrs = 2`.

```{r read-specific-band}
RGB_band2_HARV <-  
  rast("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif", 
       lyrs = 2)
```

We can convert this data to a data frame and plot the same way we plotted the red band:

```{r}
RGB_band2_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(RGB_band2_HARV, xy = TRUE)
```

```{r rgb-harv-band2}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = RGB_band2_HARV_df,
              aes(x = x, y = y, alpha = HARV_RGB_Ortho_2)) + 
  coord_equal()
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge: Making Sense of Single Band Images

Compare the plots of band 1 (red) and band 2 (green). Is the forested area 
darker or lighter in band 2 (the green band) compared to band 1 (the red band)?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

We'd expect a *brighter* value for the forest in band 2 (green) than in band 1 
(red) because the leaves on trees of most often appear "green" - healthy leaves 
reflect MORE green light than red light.

## Raster Stacks in R

Next, we will work with all three image bands (red, green and blue) as an R 
raster object. We will then plot a 3-band composite, or full color, image.

To bring in all bands of a multi-band raster, we use the`rast()` function.

```{r intro-to-raster-stacks}
RGB_stack_HARV <- 
  rast("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")
```

Let's preview the attributes of our stack object:

```{r}
RGB_stack_HARV
```

We can view the attributes of each band in the stack in a single output. For 
example, if we had hundreds of bands, we could specify which band we'd like to 
view attributes for using an index value:

```{r}
RGB_stack_HARV[[2]]
```

We can also use the `ggplot` functions to plot the data in any layer of our 
raster object. Remember, we need to convert to a data frame first.

```{r}
RGB_stack_HARV_df  <- as.data.frame(RGB_stack_HARV, xy = TRUE)
```

Each band in our RasterStack gets its own column in the data frame. Thus we have:

```{r}
str(RGB_stack_HARV_df)
```

Let's create a histogram of the first band:

```{r rgb-harv-hist-band1}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = RGB_stack_HARV_df, aes(HARV_RGB_Ortho_1))
```

And a raster plot of the second band:

```{r rgb-harv-plot-band2}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = RGB_stack_HARV_df,
              aes(x = x, y = y, alpha = HARV_RGB_Ortho_2)) + 
  coord_quickmap()
```

We can access any individual band in the same way.

### Create A Three Band Image

To render a final three band, colored image in R, we use the `plotRGB()` function.

This function allows us to:

1. Identify what bands we want to render in the red, green and blue regions. 
   The `plotRGB()` function defaults to a 1=red, 2=green, and 3=blue band 
   order. However, you can define what bands you'd like to plot manually. 
   Manual definition of bands is useful if you have, for example a 
   near-infrared band and want to create a color infrared image.
2. Adjust the `stretch` of the image to increase or decrease contrast.

Let's plot our 3-band image. Note that we can use the `plotRGB()` function 
directly with our RasterStack object (we don't need a dataframe as this 
function isn't part of the `ggplot2` package).

```{r plot-rgb-image}
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3)
```

The image above looks pretty good. We can explore whether applying a stretch to
the image might improve clarity and contrast using `stretch="lin"` or
`stretch="hist"`.

![](fig/dc-spatial-raster/imageStretch_dark.jpg){alt='Image Stretch'}

When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 0, a darker image is 
rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend to the full 0-255 
range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of the image.

![](fig/dc-spatial-raster/imageStretch_light.jpg){alt='Image Stretch light'}

When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 255, a lighter image is 
rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend to the full 0-255 
range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of the image.

```{r plot-rbg-image-linear}
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        scale = 800,
        stretch = "lin")
```

```{r plot-rgb-image-hist}
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        scale = 800,
        stretch = "hist")
```

In this case, the stretch doesn't enhance the contrast our image significantly 
given the distribution of reflectance (or brightness) values is distributed 
well between 0 and 255.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge - NoData Values

Let's explore what happens with NoData values when working with RasterStack 
objects and using the `plotRGB()` function. We will use the 
`HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif` GeoTIFF file in the 
`NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/` directory.

1. View the files attributes. Are there `NoData` values assigned for this file?
2. If so, what is the `NoData` Value?
3. How many bands does it have?
4. Load the multi-band raster file into R.
5. Plot the object as a true color image.
6. What happened to the black edges in the data?
7. What does this tell us about the difference in the data structure between
  `HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif` and `HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif` (R object `RGB_stack`). How can 
  you check?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Answers

1) First we use the `describe()` function to view the data attributes.

```{r}
describe("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif")
```

2) From the output above, we see that there are `NoData` values and they are 
assigned the value of -9999.

3) The data has three bands.

4) To read in the file, we will use the `rast()` function:

```{r}
HARV_NA <- 
  rast("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif")
```

5) We can plot the data with the `plotRGB()` function:

```{r harv-na-rgb}
plotRGB(HARV_NA,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3)
```

6) The black edges are not plotted.

7) Both data sets have `NoData` values, however, in the RGB\_stack the NoData 
value is not defined in the tiff tags, thus R renders them as black as the 
reflectance values are 0. The black edges in the other file are defined as 
-9999 and R renders them as NA.

```{r}
describe("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")
```

## Data Tip

We can create a raster object from several, individual single-band GeoTIFFs 
too. We will do this in a later episode,
[Raster Time Series Data in R](12-time-series-raster/).


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## SpatRaster in R

The R SpatRaster object type can handle rasters with multiple bands.
The SpatRaster only holds parameters that describe the properties of raster 
data that is located somewhere on our computer.

A SpatRasterDataset object can hold references to sub-datasets, that is, 
SpatRaster objects. In most cases, we can work with a SpatRaster in the same 
way we might work with a SpatRasterDataset. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## More Resources

You can read the help for the `rast()` and `sds()` functions by typing `?rast`
or `?sds`.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


We can build a SpatRasterDataset using a SpatRaster or a list of SpatRaster:

```{r}
RGB_sds_HARV <- sds(RGB_stack_HARV)
RGB_sds_HARV <- sds(list(RGB_stack_HARV, RGB_stack_HARV))
```

We can retrieve the SpatRaster objects from a SpatRasterDataset using 
subsetting:

```{r}
RGB_sds_HARV[[1]]
RGB_sds_HARV[[2]]
```

## Challenge: What Functions Can Be Used on an R Object of a particular class?

We can view various functions (or methods) available to use on an R object with
`methods(class=class(objectNameHere))`. Use this to figure out:

1. What methods can be used on the `RGB_stack_HARV` object?
2. What methods can be used on a single band within `RGB_stack_HARV`?
3. Why do you think there isn't a difference?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Answers

1) We can see a list of all of the methods available for our
  RasterStack object:

```{r}
methods(class=class(RGB_stack_HARV))
```

2) And compare that with the methods available for a single band:

```{r}
methods(class=class(RGB_stack_HARV[[1]]))
```

3) A SpatRaster is the same no matter its number of bands.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- A single raster file can contain multiple bands or layers.
- Use the `rast()` function to load all bands in a multi-layer raster file into R.
- Individual bands within a SpatRaster can be accessed, analyzed, and visualized using the same functions no matter how many bands it holds.
