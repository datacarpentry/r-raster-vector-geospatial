## Things You'll Need To Complete This Episode

See the [lesson homepage](.) for detailed information about the software, data, 
and other prerequisites you will need to work through the examples in this 
episode.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This episode covers how to work with and plot a raster time series, using an R 
raster object. It also covers practical assessment of data quality in remote 
sensing derived imagery.

## About Raster Time Series Data

A raster data file can contain one single band or many bands. If the raster 
data contains imagery data, each band may represent reflectance for a different
wavelength (color or type of light) or set of wavelengths - for example red, 
green and blue. A multi-band raster may two or more bands or layers of data 
collected at different times for the same extent (region) and of the same 
resolution. For this episode, we will work with a time series of normalized 
difference vegetation index (NDVI) and RGB data from the Harvard Forest site.
We introduced the concepts of NDVI and RGB data in 
[an earlier lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/01-intro-raster-data) 
and worked with an RGB RasterStack in the 
[Work with Multi-band Rasters in R](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/05-raster-multi-band-in-r) episode.

In this episode, we will:

1. Import NDVI data in GeoTIFF format.
2. Import, explore and plot NDVI data derived for several dates throughout the
  year.
3. View the RGB imagery used to derived the NDVI time series to better
  understand unusual / outlier values.

## RGB Data

While the NDVI data is a single band product, the RGB images that contain the
red band used to derive NDVI, contain 3 (of the 7) 30m resolution bands
available from Landsat data. The RGB directory contains RGB images for each 
time period that NDVI is available.

### Getting Started

In this episode, we will use the `terra`, `scales`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2` 
packages. Make sure you have them loaded.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(terra)
library(scales)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

To begin, we will create a list of raster files using the `list.files()`
function. This list will be used to generate a RasterStack. We will only add 
files that have a `.tif` extension to our list. To do this, we will use the 
syntax `pattern=".tif$"`. If we specify `full.names = TRUE`, the full path for 
each file will be added to the list.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Data Tip

In the pattern above, the `$` character represents the end of a line. Using it 
ensures that our pattern will only match files that end in `.tif`. This pattern 
matching uses a language called "regular expressions", which is beyond the 
scope of this workshop.

- [Regular expressions cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/regex.pdf)
  

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r import-NDVI-rasters}
ndvi_harv_path <- "data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/NDVI"

all_ndvi_harv <- list.files(ndvi_harv_path,
                            full.names = TRUE,
                            pattern = ".tif$")
```

It's a good idea to look at the file names that matched our search to make sure 
they meet our expectations.

```{r}
all_ndvi_harv
```

Now we have a list of all GeoTIFF files in the NDVI directory for Harvard
Forest. The number at the start of the filenames represents the julilan day. 
Next, we will create a stack of rasters from this list using the 
`rast()` function. We worked with the `rast()` function in 
[an earlier episode](05-raster-multi-band-in-r/).

```{r create-timeSeries-raster-stack}
ndvi_harv_stack <- rast(all_ndvi_harv)
```

We can explore the GeoTIFF tags (the embedded metadata) in a stack using the
same syntax that we used on single-band raster objects in R including: `crs()`
(coordinate reference system), `ext()` and `res()` (resolution; specifically
`yres()` and `xres()`).

```{r explore-RasterStack-tags}
crs(ndvi_harv_stack, proj = TRUE)
```

The CRS for our stack is `+proj=utm +zone=19 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs`. 
The CRS is in UTM Zone 19. If you have completed the previous episodes in this 
workshop, you may have noticed that the UTM zone for the NEON collected remote 
sensing data was in Zone 18 rather than Zone 19. Why are the Landsat data in 
Zone 19?

![](fig/dc-spatial-raster/UTM_zones_18-19.jpg){alt='Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).'}

A Landsat scene is extremely wide - spanning over 170km north to south and 
180km east to west. This means that Landsat data often cover multiple UTM 
zones. When the data are processed, the zone in which the majority of the data 
cover is the zone which is used for the final CRS. Thus, our field site at
Harvard Forest is located in UTM Zone 18, but the Landsat data is in a CRS of
UTM Zone 19.

## Plotting Time Series Data

Once we have created our RasterStack, we can visualize our data. We can use the 
`ggplot()` command to create a multi-panelled plot showing each band in our 
RasterStack. First we need to create a data frame object. Because there are 
multiple columns in our data that are not variables, we will tidy (or "pivot") 
the data so that we have a single column with the NDVI observations. We will 
use the function `pivot_longer()` from the `tidyr` package to do this:

```{r plot-time-series}
ndvi_harv_stack_df <- as.data.frame(ndvi_harv_stack, xy = TRUE) %>%
    pivot_longer(-(x:y), names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")
```

Now we can plot our data using `ggplot()`. We want to create a separate panel 
for each time point in our time series, so we will use the `facet_wrap()` 
function to create a multi-paneled plot:

```{r ndvi-wrap}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = ndvi_harv_stack_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable)
```

Look at the range of NDVI values observed in the plot above. We know that the 
accepted values for NDVI range from 0-1. Why does our data range from
0 - 10,000?

## Scale Factors

The metadata for this NDVI data specifies a scale factor: 10,000. A scale 
factor is sometimes used to maintain smaller file sizes by removing decimal 
places. Storing data in integer format keeps files sizes smaller.

Let's apply the scale factor before we go any further. Conveniently, we can
quickly apply this factor using raster math on the entire stack as follows:

```{r apply-scale-factor}
ndvi_harv_stack <- ndvi_harv_stack/10000
```

After applying our scale factor, we can recreate our plot using the same code 
we used above.

```{r ndvi-stack-wrap}
ndvi_harv_stack_df <- as.data.frame(ndvi_harv_stack, xy = TRUE) %>%
    pivot_longer(-(x:y), names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = ndvi_harv_stack_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) +
  facet_wrap(~variable)
```

## Take a Closer Look at Our Data

Let's take a closer look at the plots of our data. Massachusetts, where the 
NEON Harvard Forest Field Site is located, has a fairly consistent fall, 
winter, spring, and summer season where vegetation turns green in the spring, 
continues to grow throughout the summer, and begins to change colors and 
senesce in the fall through winter. Do you notice anything that seems unusual
about the patterns of greening and browning observed in the plots above?

Hint: the number after the "X" in each tile title is the Julian day which in
this case represents the number of days into each year. If you are unfamiliar
with Julian day, check out the NEON Data Skills
[Converting to Julian Day ](https://www.neonscience.org/julian-day-conversion-r)
tutorial.

## View Distribution of Raster Values

In the above exercise, we viewed plots of our NDVI time series and noticed a
few images seem to be unusually light. However this was only a visual
representation of potential issues in our data. What is another way we can look
at these data that is quantitative?

Next we will use histograms to explore the distribution of NDVI values stored 
in each raster.

```{r view-stack-histogram}
ggplot(ndvi_harv_stack_df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(value)) + 
  facet_wrap(~variable)
```

It seems like things get green in the spring and summer like we expect, but the
data at Julian days 277 and 293 are unusual. It appears as if the vegetation 
got green in the spring, but then died back only to get green again towards the 
end of the year. Is this right?

### Explore Unusual Data Patterns

The NDVI data that we are using comes from 2011, perhaps a strong freeze around
Julian day 277 could cause a vegetation to senesce early, however in the 
eastern United States, it seems unusual that it would proceed to green up again 
shortly thereafter.

Let's next view some temperature data for our field site to see whether there
were some unusual fluctuations that may explain this pattern of greening and
browning seen in the NDVI data. First we will read in the temperature data and 
preview the structure of that dataframe:

```{r view-temp-data}
harv_met_daily <-
  read.csv("data/NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series/HARV/FisherTower-Met/hf001-06-daily-m.csv")

str(harv_met_daily)
```

The `date` column is currently coded as a character. We want to be able to 
treat it as a date, so we will use the `as.Date()` function to convert it. We 
need to tell R what format the data is in. Our dates are YYY-MM-DD, which is 
represented by R as `%Y-%m-%d`.

```{r}
harv_met_daily$date <- as.Date(harv_met_daily$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

We only want to look at the data from 2011:

```{r}
yr_11_daily_avg <- harv_met_daily %>%
  filter(between(date, as.Date('2011-01-01'), as.Date('2011-12-31')))
```

Now we can plot the air temperature (the `airt` column) by Julian day (the `jd` 
column):

```{r air-temperature}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = yr_11_daily_avg, aes(jd, airt)) +
  ggtitle("Daily Mean Air Temperature",
          subtitle = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site") +
  xlab("Julian Day 2011") +
  ylab("Mean Air Temperature (C)")
```

There are no significant peaks or dips in the temperature during the late 
summer or early fall time period that might account for patterns seen in the 
NDVI data. Let's have a look at the source Landsat imagery that was partially 
used used to derive our NDVI rasters to try to understand what appear to be 
outlier NDVI values.

```{r ndvi-plots, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# code not shown, demonstration only
# Plot RGB data for Julian day 133
rgb_133 <- rast("data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/RGB/133_HARV_landRGB.tif")

# NOTE: Fix the bands' names so they don't start with a number!
names(rgb_133) <- paste0("X", names(rgb_133))

quantiles = c(0.02, 0.98)
r <- stats::quantile(values(rgb_133$X133_HARV_landRGB_1), quantiles, 
                     na.rm = TRUE)
g <- stats::quantile(values(rgb_133$X133_HARV_landRGB_2), quantiles, 
                     na.rm = TRUE)
b <- stats::quantile(values(rgb_133$X133_HARV_landRGB_3), quantiles, 
                     na.rm = TRUE)
rgb_133_df <- as.data.frame(rgb_133, xy = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(tempR = (X133_HARV_landRGB_1 - r[1])/(r[2] - r[1]),
         tempG = (X133_HARV_landRGB_2 - g[1])/(g[2] - g[1]),
         tempB = (X133_HARV_landRGB_3 - b[1])/(b[2] - b[1]),
         tempR = case_when(
             tempR < 0 ~ 0,
             tempR > 1 ~ 1,
             TRUE ~ tempR),
         tempG = case_when(
             tempG < 0 ~ 0,
             tempG > 1 ~ 1,
             TRUE ~ tempG),
         tempB = case_when(
             tempB < 0 ~ 0,
             tempB > 1 ~ 1,
             TRUE ~ tempB),
         rgb = rgb(tempR,tempG,tempB)
           ) %>%
    dplyr::select(-(tempR:tempB))

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = rgb_133_df, aes(x, y), fill = rgb_133_df$rgb) + 
  ggtitle("Julian day 133")

# Plot RGB data for Julian day 197
RGB_197 <- rast("data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/RGB/197_HARV_landRGB.tif")

# NOTE: Fix the bands' names so they don't start with a number!
names(RGB_197) <- paste0("X", names(RGB_197))

RGB_197 <- RGB_197/255
r <- quantile(values(RGB_197$X197_HARV_landRGB_1), quantiles, na.rm = TRUE)

## Challenge: Examine RGB Raster Files

Plot the RGB images for the Julian days 277 and 293. Compare those with the RGB
plots for Julian days 133 and 197 (shown above). Does the RGB imagery from 
these two days explain the low NDVI values observed on these days?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Answers

First we need to load in the RGB data for Julian day 277 and look at its 
metadata.

```{r}
rgb_277 <- rast("data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/RGB/277_HARV_landRGB.tif")

# NOTE: Fix the bands' names so they don't start with a number!
names(rgb_277) <- paste0("X", names(rgb_277))

rgb_277
```

The RGB data has a max value of 255, but we need our color intensity to be 
between 0 and 1, so we will divide our RasterStack object by 255.

```{r}
rgb_277 <- rgb_277/255
```

Next we convert it to a dataframe.

```{r}
rgb_277_df <- as.data.frame(rgb_277, xy = TRUE)
```

We create RGB colors from the three channels:

```{r}
rgb_277_df$rgb <- 
  with(rgb_277_df, rgb(X277_HARV_landRGB_1, X277_HARV_landRGB_2, 
                       X277_HARV_landRGB_3, 1))
```

Finally, we can plot the RGB data for Julian day 277.

```{r rgb-277}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data=rgb_277_df, aes(x, y), fill=rgb_277_df$rgb) + 
  ggtitle("Julian day 277") 
```

We then do the same steps for Julian day 293

```{r rgb-293}
# Julian day 293
rgb_293 <- rast("data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/RGB/293_HARV_landRGB.tif")
names(rgb_293) <- paste0("X", names(rgb_293))
rgb_293 <- rgb_293/255
rgb_293_df <- as.data.frame(rgb_293, xy = TRUE)
rgb_293_df$rgb <- 
  with(rgb_293_df, rgb(X293_HARV_landRGB_1, X293_HARV_landRGB_2, 
                       X293_HARV_landRGB_3,1))
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = rgb_293_df, aes(x, y), fill = rgb_293_df$rgb) +
  ggtitle("Julian day 293")
```

This example highlights the importance of exploring the source of a derived 
data product. In this case, the NDVI data product was created using Landsat 
imagery - specifically the red and near-infrared bands. When we look at the RGB 
collected at Julian days 277 and 293 we see that most of the image is filled 
with clouds. The very low NDVI values resulted from cloud cover — a common 
challenge that we encounter when working with satellite remote sensing imagery.
