This episode covers how to work with and plot a raster time series, using an
R RasterStack object. It also covers practical assessment of data quality in
remote sensing derived imagery. 

## About Raster Time Series Data

A raster data file can contain one single band or many bands. If the raster data
contains imagery data, each band may represent reflectance for a different
wavelength (color or type of light) or set of wavelengths - for
example red, green and blue. A multi-band raster may two or more bands or layers
of data collected at different times for the same extent (region) and of the
same resolution. For this episode, we will work with a time series
of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and RGB data from the Harvard Forest site. 
We introduced the concepts of NDVI and RGB data in [an earlier lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/01-spatial-data-structures-formats/index.html) and worked with an RGB RasterStack in the [Work with Multi-band Rasters in R]({{ site.baseurl }}/ 05-raster-multi-band-in-r/) episode. 

In this episode, we will:

1. Import NDVI data in GeoTIFF format.
2. Import, explore and plot NDVI data derived for several dates throughout the
year.
3. View the RGB imagery used to derived the NDVI time series to better
understand unusual / outlier values.

## RGB Data
While the NDVI data is a single band product, the RGB images that contain the
red band used to derive NDVI, contain 3 (of the 7) 30m resolution bands
available from Landsat data. The RGB directory contains RGB images for each time
period that NDVI is available.

### Getting Started
In this episode, we will use the `raster`, `rgdal`, `reshape`, and `scales` packages. Make sure you have them loaded.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(reshape)
library(scales)
```

To begin, we will create a list of raster files using the `list.files()`
function. This list will be used to generate a RasterStack. We will
only add files that have a `.tif` extension to our list. To do this, we will use the syntax
`pattern=".tif$"`. If we specify `full.names = TRUE`, the full path for each file will be added to
the list.

> ## Data Tip
> In the pattern above, the `$` character represents the end of a line. Using it ensures
> that our pattern will only match files that end in `.tif`. This pattern matching uses a 
> language called "regular expressions", which is beyond the scope of this workshop. 
> 
> * [Regular expressions tutorial](https://regexone.com/)
> * [Regular expressions cheatsheet](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/27610/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet-v2.pdf)
{: .callout}

```{r import-NDVI-rasters }
NDVI_HARV_path <- "data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/NDVI"

all_NDVI_HARV <- list.files(NDVI_HARV_path,
                            full.names = TRUE,
                            pattern = ".tif$")
```

It's a good idea to look at the file names that matched our search to make sure they
meet our expectations. 

```{r}
all_NDVI_HARV
```

Now we have a list of all GeoTIFF files in the NDVI directory for Harvard
Forest. Next, we will create a RasterStack from this list using the `stack()`
function. We introduced the `stack()` function in [an earlier episode]({{ site.baseurl }}/05-raster-multi-band-in-r/).

```{r create-timeSeries-raster-stack }
NDVI_HARV_stack <- stack(all_NDVI_HARV)
```

We can explore the GeoTIFF tags (the embedded metadata) in a stack using the
same syntax that we used on single-band raster objects in R including: `crs()`
(coordinate reference system), `extent()` and `res()` (resolution; specifically
`yres()` and `xres()`).

```{r explore-RasterStack-tags}
crs(NDVI_HARV_stack)
```

The CRS for our stack is `+proj=utm +zone=19 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs`. The
CRS is in UTM Zone 19. If you have completed the previous episodes in
this workshop, you may have noticed that the UTM zone for the NEON collected remote sensing
data was in Zone 18 rather than Zone 19. Why are the Landsat data in Zone 19?

![Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).](../images/dc-spatial-raster/UTM_zones_18-19.jpg)

A Landsat scene is extremely wide - spanning over 170km north to
south and 180km east to west. This means that Landsat data often cover multiple
UTM zones. When the data are processed, the zone in which the majority of the
data cover is the zone which is used for the final CRS. Thus, our field site at
Harvard Forest is located in UTM Zone 18, but the Landsat data is in a CRS of
UTM Zone 19.

## Plotting Time Series Data
Once we have created our RasterStack, we can visualize our data. We can use
the `ggplot()` command to create a multi-panelled plot showing each band in our RasterStack. First we
need to create a data frame object. Because there are multiple bands in our data, we will reshape (or "melt")
the data so that we have a single column with 
the NDVI observations. We will use the function
`melt()` from the `reshape` package to do this: 

```{r plot-time-series}
NDVI_HARV_stack_df <- as.data.frame(NDVI_HARV_stack, xy = TRUE) %>%
    melt(id.vars = c('x','y'))
```

Now we can plot our data using `ggplot()`. We want
to create a separate panel for each time point in our
time series, so we will use the `facet_wrap()` 
function to create a multi-paneled plot: 

```{r ndvi-wrap}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = NDVI_HARV_stack_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable)
```

Look at the range of NDVI values observed in the plot above. We know that
the accepted values for NDVI range from 0-1. Why does our data range from
0 - 10,000?

## Scale Factors
The metadata for this NDVI data specifies a scale factor: 10,000. A scale factor
is sometimes used to maintain smaller file sizes by removing decimal places.
Storing data in integer format keeps files sizes smaller.

Let's apply the scale factor before we go any further. Conveniently, we can
quickly apply this factor using raster math on the entire stack as follows:

```{r apply-scale-factor }
NDVI_HARV_stack <- NDVI_HARV_stack/10000
```

After applying our scale factor, we can recreate our plot using the same code we used above.

```{r ndvi-stack-wrap}
NDVI_HARV_stack_df <- as.data.frame(NDVI_HARV_stack, xy = TRUE) %>%
    melt(id.vars = c('x','y'))

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = NDVI_HARV_stack_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) +
  facet_wrap(~variable)
```

## Take a Closer Look at Our Data

Let's take a closer look at the plots of our data. Massachusetts, 
where the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site is located, has a fairly consistent
fall, winter, spring, and summer season where vegetation turns green in the
spring, continues to grow throughout the summer, and begins to change colors and
senesce in the fall through winter. Do you notice anything that seems unusual
about the patterns of greening and browning observed in the plots above?

Hint: the number after the "X" in each tile title is the Julian day which in
this case represents the number of days into each year. If you are unfamiliar
with Julian day, check out the NEON Data Skills
[Converting to Julian Day ](https://www.neonscience.org/julian-day-conversion-r)
tutorial.

## View Distribution of Raster Values
In the above exercise, we viewed plots of our NDVI time series and noticed a
few images seem to be unusually light. However this was only a visual
representation of potential issues in our data. What is another way we can look
at these data that is quantitative?

Next we will use histograms to explore the distribution of NDVI values stored in
each raster.

```{r view-stack-histogram }
ggplot(NDVI_HARV_stack_df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(value)) +
    facet_wrap(~variable)
```

It seems like things get green in the spring and summer like we expect, but the
data at Julian days 277 and 293 are unusual. It appears as if the vegetation got
green in the spring, but then died back only to get green again towards the end
of the year. Is this right?

### Explore Unusual Data Patterns
The NDVI data that we are using comes from 2011, perhaps a strong freeze around
Julian day 277 could cause a vegetation to senesce early, however in the eastern
United States, it seems unusual that it would proceed to green up again shortly
thereafter.

Let's next view some temperature data for our field site to see whether there
were some unusual fluctuations that may explain this pattern of greening and
browning seen in the NDVI data. First we will read in the temperature data and preview the structure
of that dataframe:

```{r view-temp-data}
har_met_daily <-
  read.csv("data/NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series/HARV/FisherTower-Met/hf001-06-daily-m.csv")

str(har_met_daily)
```

The `date` column is currently coded as a factor. We want to be able to treat it as a date,
so we will use the `as.Date()` function to convert it. We need to tell R what format the
data is in. Our dates are YYY-MM-DD, which is represented by R as `%Y-%m-%d`.

```{r}
har_met_daily$date <- as.Date(har_met_daily$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

We only want to look at the data from 2011:

```{r}
yr_11_daily_avg <- subset(har_met_daily,
                            date >= as.Date('2011-01-01') &
                            date <= as.Date('2011-12-31'))
```

Now we can plot the air temperature (the `airt` column) by Julian day (the `jd` column):

```{r air-temperature}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = yr_11_daily_avg, aes(jd, airt)) +
  ggtitle("Daily Mean Air Temperature",
          subtitle = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site") +
  xlab("Julian Day 2011") +
  ylab("Mean Air Temperature (C)")
```

There are no significant peaks or dips in the temperature during the late summer
or early fall time period that might account for patterns seen in the NDVI data. 
Let's have a look at the source Landsat imagery that was partially used used to
derive our NDVI rasters to try to understand what appear to be outlier NDVI values.

```{r ndvi-plots, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# code not shown, demonstration only
# Plot RGB data for Julian day 133
RGB_133 <- stack("data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/RGB/133_HARV_landRGB.tif")
RGB_133_df <- as.data.frame(RGB_133, xy = TRUE)
quantiles = c(0.02, 0.98)
r <- quantile(RGB_133_df$X133_HARV_landRGB.1, quantiles, na.rm = TRUE)
g <- quantile(RGB_133_df$X133_HARV_landRGB.2, quantiles, na.rm = TRUE)
b <- quantile(RGB_133_df$X133_HARV_landRGB.3, quantiles, na.rm = TRUE)
tempR <-  (RGB_133_df$X133_HARV_landRGB.1 - r[1])/(r[2] - r[1])
tempG <-  (RGB_133_df$X133_HARV_landRGB.2 - g[1])/(g[2] - g[1])

tempB[tempB < 0] <- 0
tempR[tempR > 1] <- 1

RGB_133_df$rgb <- rgb(tempR,tempG,tempB)
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = RGB_133_df, aes(x, y), fill = RGB_133_df$rgb) + 
  ggtitle("Julian day 133")

# Plot RGB data for Julian day 197
RGB_197 <- stack("data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/RGB/197_HARV_landRGB.tif")
RGB_197 <- RGB_197/255
RGB_197_df <- as.data.frame(RGB_197, xy = TRUE)

tempR <-  (RGB_197_df$X197_HARV_landRGB.1 - r[1])/(r[2] - r[1])
tempG <-  (RGB_197_df$X197_HARV_landRGB.2 - g[1])/(g[2] - g[1])
tempB <-  (RGB_197_df$X197_HARV_landRGB.3 - b[1])/(b[2] - b[1])
tempR[tempR < 0] <- 0
tempG[tempG < 0] <- 0
tempB[tempB < 0] <- 0
tempR[tempR > 1] <- 1
tempG[tempG > 1] <- 1
tempB[tempB > 1] <- 1
RGB_197_df$rgb <- rgb(tempR,tempG,tempB)
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = RGB_197_df, aes(x, y), fill = RGB_197_df$rgb) + 
  ggtitle("Julian day 197")
```
