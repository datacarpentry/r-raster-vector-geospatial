## Things You'll Need To Complete This Episode

See the [lesson homepage](.) for detailed information about the software, data,
and other prerequisites you will need to work through the examples in this
episode.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Starting with this episode, we will be moving from working with raster data to
working with vector data. In this episode, we will open and plot point, line
and polygon vector data loaded from ESRI's `shapefile` format into R. These data refer to
the
[NEON Harvard Forest field site](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV),
which we have been working with in previous episodes. In later episodes, we
will learn how to work with raster and vector data together and combine them
into a single plot.

## Import Vector Data

We will use the `sf` package to work with vector data in R. `sf` stands for
[simple features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features), an international standard for
representing spatial data that is used widely by databases (e.g., PostGIS) and other open source
geospatial software (e.g., GDAL). We will also use the `terra` package, which has been loaded
in previous episodes, so we can explore raster and vector spatial metadata using similar commands.

Make sure you have the `sf` library loaded.

```{r load-sf, results="hide", eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
```

The vector layers that we will import from ESRI's `shapefile` format are:

- A polygon vector layer representing our field site boundary,
- A line vector layer representing roads, and
- A point vector layer representing the location of the [Fisher flux tower](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/flux-tower-measurements)
  located at the [NEON Harvard Forest field site](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV).

The first vector layer that we will open contains the boundary of our study area
(or our Area Of Interest or AOI, hence the name `aoiBoundary`). To import
a vector layer from an ESRI `shapefile` we use the `sf` function `st_read()`. `st_read()`
requires the file path to the ESRI `shapefile`.

Let's import our AOI:

```{r Import-Shapefile}
aoi_boundary_harv <- st_read(
  "data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HarClip_UTMZ18.shp")
```

## Vector Layer Metadata \& Attributes

When we import the `HarClip_UTMZ18` vector layer from an ESRI `shapefile` into R (as our
`aoi_boundary_harv` object), the `st_read()` function automatically stores
information about the data. We are particularly interested in the geospatial
metadata, describing the format, CRS, extent, and other components of the
vector data, and the attributes which describe properties associated with each
individual vector object.

## Data Tip

The [Explore and Plot by Vector Layer Attributes](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/07-vector-shapefile-attributes-in-r)
episode provides more information on both metadata and attributes
and using attributes to subset and plot data.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Spatial Metadata

Key metadata for all vector layers includes:

1. **Object Type:** the class of the imported object.
2. **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** the projection of the data.
3. **Extent:** the spatial extent (i.e. geographic area that the vector layer
   covers) of the data. Note that the spatial extent for a vector layer
   represents the combined extent for all individual objects in the vector layer.

We can view metadata of a vector layer using the `st_geometry_type()`, `st_crs()` and
`st_bbox()` functions. First, let's view the geometry type for our AOI
vector layer:

```{r}
st_geometry_type(aoi_boundary_harv)
```

Our `aoi_boundary_harv` is a polygon spatial object. The 18 levels shown below our
output list the possible categories of the geometry type. Now let's check what
CRS this file data is in:

```{r}
st_crs(aoi_boundary_harv)
```

Our data in the CRS **UTM zone 18N**. The CRS is critical to interpreting the
spatial object's extent values as it specifies units. To find the extent of our AOI, we
can use the `st_bbox()` function:

```{r}
st_bbox(aoi_boundary_harv)
```

The spatial extent of a vector layer or R spatial object represents the geographic
"edge" or location that is the furthest north, south east and west. Thus it
represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object. Image Source:
National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).

Lastly, we can view all of the metadata and attributes for this R spatial
object by printing it to the screen:

```{r}
aoi_boundary_harv
```

## Spatial Data Attributes

We introduced the idea of spatial data attributes in
[an earlier lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/02-intro-vector-data).
Now we will explore how to use spatial data attributes stored in our data to
plot different features.

## Plot a vector layer

Next, let's visualize the data in our `sf` object using the `ggplot` package.
Unlike with raster data, we do not need to convert vector data to a dataframe
before plotting with `ggplot`.

We're going to customize our boundary plot by setting the size, color, and fill
for our plot. When plotting `sf` objects with `ggplot2`, you need to use the
`coord_sf()` coordinate system.

```{r plot-shapefile}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_harv, size = 3, color = "black", fill = "cyan1") +
  ggtitle("AOI Boundary Plot") +
  coord_sf()
```


On the boundary plot, the x and y axes are labeled in units of decimal degrees. However, the CRS
for `aoi_boundary_harv` is UTM zone 18N, which has units of meters. `geom_sf` will use
the CRS of the data to set the CRS for the plot, so why is there a mismatch?

By default, `coord_sf()` generates a graticule with a CRS of WGS 84 (where the units
are decimal degrees), and this sets our axis labels. To draw the graticule in the native
CRS of our shapefile, we can set `datum=NULL` in the `coord_sf()` function.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge: Import Line and Point Vector Layers

Using the steps above, import the HARV\_roads and HARVtower\_UTM18N vector layers into
R. Call the HARV\_roads object `lines_harv` and the HARVtower\_UTM18N
`point_harv`.

Answer the following questions:

1. What type of R spatial object is created when you import each layer?

2. What is the CRS and extent for each object?

3. Do the files contain points, lines, or polygons?

4. How many spatial objects are in each file?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Answers

First we import the data:

```{r import-point-line, echo=TRUE}
lines_harv <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARV_roads.shp")
point_harv <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARVtower_UTM18N.shp")
```

Then we check its class:

```{r}
class(lines_harv)
class(point_harv)
```

We also check the CRS and extent of each object:

```{r}
st_crs(lines_harv)
st_bbox(lines_harv)
st_crs(point_harv)
st_bbox(point_harv)
```

To see the number of objects in each file, we can look at the output from when
we read these objects into R. `lines_harv` contains 13 features (all lines) and
`point_harv` contains only one point.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Metadata for vector layers include geometry type, CRS, and extent.
- Load spatial objects into R with the `st_read()` function.
- Spatial objects can be plotted directly with `ggplot` using the `geom_sf()`
  function. No need to convert to a dataframe.
