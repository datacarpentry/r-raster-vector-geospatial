##About the NEON / Data Carpentry Hackathon 

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is hosting a 3-day lesson-building hackathon to develop a suite of NEON/ Data Carpentry data tutorials and corresponding assessment instruments. The tutorials and assessment instruments will be used to teach fundamental big data skills needed to work efficiently with large spatio-temporal data using open tools, such as R, Python and postgres SQL.
