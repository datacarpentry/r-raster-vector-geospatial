efficient methods - the overlay function compared to basic subtraction. We also 
cover how to extract pixel values from a set of locations - for example a buffer
region around plot locations at a field site. Finally, it explains the basic 
principles of writing functions in R."

## About
We often want to combine values of and perform calculations on rasters to create 
a new output raster. This tutorial covers three commonly used R functions 
including: `overlay`,`calc` and raster math.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

## Raster Calculations in R
We often want to perform calculations on two or more rasters to create a new 
output raster. For example, if we are interested in mapping the heights of trees
across an entire field site, we might want to calculate the *difference* between
the Digital Surface Model (DSM, tops of trees) and the 
Digital Terrain Model (DTM, ground level). The resulting dataset is referred to 
as a Canopy Height Model (CHM) and represents the actual height of trees, 
buildings, etc with the influence of ground elevation removed.

What is a CHM, DSM and DTM? About Gridded, Raster LiDAR Data</a>. 


### Load the Data 
We will need the `raster` package to import and perform raster calculations. We
will use the DTM (`NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif`) 
and DSM (`NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif`) from the
NEON Harvard Forest Field site.

```{r load-libraries }
#load raster package
library(raster)

#view info about the dtm & dsm raster data that we will work with.
GDALinfo("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")
GDALinfo("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

```

As seen from the `geoTiff` tags, both rasters have:

* the same `CRS`, 
* the same `resolution` 
* defined minimum and maximum values.

Let's load the data. 

``` {r load-plot-data}
#load the DTM & DSM rasters
DTM_HARV <- raster("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")
DSM_HARV <- raster("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

#create a quick plot of each to see what we're dealing with
plot(DTM_HARV,
     main="Digital Terrain Model (Elevation)\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")

plot(DSM_HARV,
     main="Digital Surface Model (Elevation)\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

## Two Ways to Perform Raster Calculations

We can calculate the difference between two rasters in two different ways:

* by directly subtracting the two rasters in `R` using raster math

or for more efficient processing - particularly if our rasters are large and/or
the calculations we are performing are complex:

* using the `overlay()` function.

## Raster Math & Canopy Height Models
We can perform raster calculations by simply subtracting (or adding,
multiplying, etc) two rasters. In the geospatial world, we call this
*raster math*.

Let's subtract the DTM from the DSM to create a Canopy Height Model.

```{r raster-math }
# Raster math example
CHM_HARV <- DSM_HARV - DTM_HARV 

#plot the output CHM
plot(CHM_HARV,
     main="Canopy Height Model - Raster Math Subtract\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
     axes=FALSE) 

```

Let's have a look at the distribution of values in our newly created
Canopy Height Model (CHM).

```{r create-hist }
#histogram of CHM_HARV
hist(CHM_HARV,
  col="springgreen4",
  main="Histogram of Canopy Height Model\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
  ylab="Number of Pixels",
  xlab="Tree Height (m) ")

```

Notice that the range of values for the output CHM is between 0 and 30 meters.
Does this make sense for trees in Harvard Forest?

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge: Explore CHM Raster Values
It's often a good idea to explore the range of values in a raster dataset just
like we might explore a dataset that we collected in the field.  

1. What is the min and maximum value for the Harvard Forest Canopy 
Height Model (`CHM_HARV`) that we just created?
2. What are two ways you can check this range of data in `CHM_HARV`? 
3. What is the distribution of all the pixel values in the CHM? 
4. Plot a histogram with 6 bins instead of the default and change the color of
the histogram. 
5. Plot the `CHM_HARV` raster using breaks that make sense for the data. Include
a appropriate color palette for the data, plot title and no axes ticks / labels. 

</div>

```{r challenge-code-CHM-HARV,  include=TRUE, results="hide", echo=FALSE} 
#1) 
minValue(CHM_HARV)
maxValue(CHM_HARV)
#2) Looks at histogram, minValue(NAME)/maxValue(NAME), NAME and look at values
# slot. 
#3
hist(CHM_HARV, 
     col="springgreen4",
     main = "Histogram of Canopy Height Model\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
     maxpixels=ncell(CHM_HARV))
#4 
hist(CHM_HARV, 
     col="lightgreen",
     main = "Histogram of Canopy Height Model\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
     maxpixels=ncell(CHM_HARV),
     breaks=6)
#5
myCol=terrain.colors(4)
plot(CHM_HARV,
     breaks=c(0,10,20,30),
     col=myCol,
     axes=F,
     main="Canopy Height Model \nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site")

```

## Efficient Raster Calculations: Overlay Function
Raster math, like we just did, is an appropriate approach to raster calculations
if:

1. The rasters we are using are small in size.
2. The calculations we are performing are simple.

However, raster math is a less efficient
approach as computation becomes more complex or as file sizes become large. 
The `overlay()` function is more efficient when:

1. The rasters we are using are larger in size. 
2. The rasters are stored as individual files. 
3. The computations performed are complex. 

The `overlay()` function takes two or more rasters and applies a function to
them using efficient processing methods. The syntax is

`outputRaster <- overlay(raster1, raster2, fun=functionName)`

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** If the rasters are stacked and stored 
as `RasterStack` or `RasterBrick` objects in `R`, then we should use `calc()`. 
`overlay()` will not work on stacked rasters. 
{: .notice}

Let's perform the same subtraction calculation that we calculated above using 
raster math, using the `overlay()` function.  

```{r raster-overlay }
CHM_ov_HARV<- overlay(DSM_HARV,
                      DTM_HARV,
                      fun=function(r1, r2){return(r1-r2)})

plot(CHM_ov_HARV,
  main="Canopy Height Model - Overlay Subtract\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

How do the plots of the CHM created with manual raster math and the `overlay()`
function compare?  

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** A function consists of a define set of 
tasks performed on a input object. Functions are particularly useful for tasks
that need to be repeated over and over in the code. A simplified syntax for a
function in R is:
`functionName <- function(variable1, variable2){WhatYouWantDone, WhatToReturn}`
{: .notice }

## Export a GeoTIFF
Now that we've created a new raster, let's export the data as a `GeoTIFF` using
the `writeRaster` function. 

When we write this raster object to a `GeoTIFF` file we'll name it 
`chm_HARV.tiff`. This name allows us to quickly remember both what the data
contains (CHM data) and for where (HARVard Forest). The `writeRaster()` function
by default writes the output file to your working directory unless you specify a 
full file path.

```{r write-raster }
#export CHM object to new GeotIFF
writeRaster(CHM_ov_HARV, "chm_HARV.tiff",
            format="GTiff",  #specify output format - GeoTIFF
            overwrite=TRUE, #CAUTION: if this is true, it will overwrite an
                            # existing file
            NAflag=-9999) #set no data value to -9999

```

### writeRaster Options
The options that we used above include:

* **format:** specify that the format will be `GTiff` or `geoTiff`. 
* **overwrite:** If TRUE, `R` will overwrite any existing file  with the same
name in the specified directory. USE THIS SETTING WITH CAUTION!
* **NAflag:** set the `geotiff` tag for `NoData` to -9999, the National
Ecological Observatory Network's (NEON) standard `NoData` value.

## Challenge: Explore the NEON San Joaquin Experimental Range Field Site

Data are often more interesting and powerful when we compare them across various 
locations. Let's compare some data collected over Harvard Forest to data
collected in Southern California. The 
<a href="http://www.neoninc.org/science-design/field-sites/san-joaquin-experimental-range" target="_blank" >NEON San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) field site </a> 
located in Southern California has a very different ecosystem and climate than
the
<a href="http://www.neoninc.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank" >NEON Harvard Forest Field Site</a>
in Massachusetts.  

Import the SJER DSM and DTM raster files and create a Canopy Height Model.
Then compare the two sites. Be sure to name your `R` objects and outputs
carefully, as follows: objectType_SJER (e.g. `DSM_SJER`). This will help you
keep track of data from different sites!

1. Import the DSM and DTM from the SJER directory (if not aready imported
in the 
[Plot Raster Data in R]({{ site.baseurl}}/R/Plot-Rasters-In-R/) 
lesson.) Don't forget to examine the data for `CRS`, bad values, etc. 
2. Create a `CHM` from the two raster layers and check to make sure the data
are what you expect. 
3. Plot the `CHM` from SJER. 
4. Export the SJER CHM as a `GeoTIFF`.
5. Compare the vegetation structure of the Harvard Forest and San Joaquin 
Experimental Range. 

Hint: plotting SJER and HARV data side-by-side is an effective way to compare
both datasets!

```{r challenge-code-SJER-CHM,include=TRUE, results="hide", echo=FALSE}

#check CRS, units, etc

#check values
hist(DTM_SJER, 
     maxpixels=ncell(DTM_SJER),
     main="Digital Terrain Model - Histogram\n NEON SJER Field Site",
     col="slategrey",
     ylab="Number of Pixels",
     xlab="Elevation (m)")

#use overlay to subtract the two rasters & create CHM

                    fun=function(r1, r2){return(r1-r2)})

     main="Canopy Height Model - Histogram\n NEON SJER Field Site",
     col="springgreen4",
     ylab="Number of Pixels",
     xlab="Elevation (m)")

#3
#plot the output
plot(CHM_SJER,
     main="Canopy Height Model - Overlay Subtract\n NEON SJER Field Site",
     axes=F)

#4 
#Write to object to file
writeRaster(CHM_SJER,"chm_ov_SJER.tiff",
            format="GTiff", 
            overwrite=TRUE, 
            NAflag=-9999)

#4.Tree heights are much shorter in SJER. 
#view histogram of HARV again. 
par(mfcol=c(2,1))
hist(CHM_HARV, 
     main="Canopy Height Model - Histogram\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
     col="springgreen4",
      ylab="Number of Pixels",
     xlab="Elevation (m)")

hist(CHM_SJER, 
  main="Canopy Height Model - Histogram\nNEON SJER Field Site",
  col="slategrey", 
  ylab="Number of Pixels",
  xlab="Elevation (m)")

```

What do these two histograms tell us about the vegetation structure at Harvard 
and SJER?
