{: .prereq}

This episode will review how to import spatial points stored in `.csv` (Comma Separated Value) format into R as an `sf` spatial object. We will also reproject data imported from a shapefile format, export this data as a shapefile, and plot raster and vector data as layers in the same plot.

## Spatial Data in Text Format

The `HARV_PlotLocations.csv` file contains `x, y` (point) locations for study
plot where NEON collects data on
[vegetation and other ecological metrics](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/terrestrial-organismal-sampling).
We would like to:

* Create a map of these plot locations.
* Export the data in a `shapefile` format to share with our colleagues. This
shapefile can be imported into any GIS software.
* Create a map showing vegetation height with plot locations layered on top.

Spatial data are sometimes stored in a text file format (`.txt` or `.csv`). If
the text file has an associated `x` and `y` location column, then we can
convert it into an `sf` spatial object. The `sf` object allows us to store both the `x,y` values that represent the coordinate location
of each point and the associated attribute data - or columns describing each
feature in the spatial object.

We will continue using the `sf` and `raster` packages in this episode.

## Import .csv
To begin let's import a `.csv` file that contains plot coordinate `x, y`
locations at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site (`HARV_PlotLocations.csv`) and look at the structure of
that new object:


~~~
plot_locations_HARV <-
  read.csv("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARV_PlotLocations.csv")

str(plot_locations_HARV)
~~~

We now have a data frame that contains 21 locations (rows) and 16 variables (attributes). Note that all of our character data was imported into R as factor (categorical) data. Next, let's explore the dataframe to determine whether it contains columns with coordinate values. If we are lucky, our `.csv` will contain columns labeled:

 * "X" and "Y" OR
 * Latitude and Longitude OR
 * easting and northing (UTM coordinates)

Let's check out the column names of our dataframe.

## Identify X,Y Location Columns

Our column names include several fields that might contain spatial information. The `plot_locations_HARV$easting`
and `plot_locations_HARV$northing` columns contain coordinate values. We can confirm
this by looking at the first six rows of our data.


~~~

We have coordinate values in our data frame. In order to convert our
data frame to an `sf` object, we also need to know the CRS
associated with those coordinate values.

There are several ways to figure out the CRS of spatial data in text format.

1. We can check the file metadata in hopes that the CRS was recorded in the
data.
2. We can explore the file itself to see if CRS information is embedded in the
file header or somewhere in the data columns.

Following the `easting` and `northing` columns, there is a `geodeticDa` and a
`utmZone` column. These appear to contain CRS information
(`datum` and `projection`). Let's view those next.


~~~
head(plot_locations_HARV$geodeticDa)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "18N" "18N" "18N" "18N" "18N" "18N"
~~~
{: .output}

It is not typical to store CRS information in a column. But this particular
file contains CRS information this way. The `geodeticDa` and `utmZone` columns
contain the information that helps us determine the CRS:

* `geodeticDa`: WGS84  -- this is geodetic datum WGS84
* `utmZone`: 18

In
[When Vector Data Don't Line Up - Handling Spatial Projection & CRS in R]({{site.baseurl}}/09-vector-when-data-dont-line-up-crs/)
we learned about the components of a `proj4` string. We have everything we need
to assign a CRS to our data frame.

To create the `proj4` associated with UTM Zone 18 WGS84 we can look up the
projection on the [Spatial Reference website](http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-18n/), which contains a list of CRS formats for each projection. From here, we can extract the [proj4 string for UTM Zone 18N WGS84](http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-18n/proj4/).

However, if we have other data in the UTM Zone 18N projection, it's much
easier to use the `st_crs()` function to extract the CRS in `proj4` format from that object and
assign it to our
new spatial object. We've seen this CRS before with our Harvard Forest study site (`point_HARV`).

The output above shows that the points shapefile is in
UTM zone 18N. We can thus use the CRS from that spatial object to convert our
non-spatial dataframe into an `sf` object.

Next, let's create a `crs` object that we can use to define the CRS of our
`sf` object when we create it.

## .csv to sf object
Next, let's convert our dataframe into an `sf` object. To do
this, we need to specify:

1. The columns containing X (`easting`) and Y (`northing`) coordinate values
2. The CRS that the column coordinate represent (units are included in the CRS) - stored in our `utmCRS` object.

We will use the `st_as_sf()` function to perform the conversion.


~~~
plot_locations_sp_HARV <- st_as_sf(plot_locations_HARV, coords = c("easting", "northing"), crs = utm18nCRS)
~~~
{: .language-r}

We should double check the CRS to make sure it is correct.

## Plot Spatial Object
We now have a spatial R object, we can plot our newly created spatial object.

  geom_sf(data = plot_locations_sp_HARV) +

## Plot Extent

In
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/06-vector-open-shapefile-in-r/)
we learned about spatial object extent. When we plot several spatial layers in
R using `ggplot`, all of the layers of the plot are considered in setting the boundaries
of the plot. To show this, let's plot our `aoi_boundary_HARV` object with our vegetation plots.


~~~
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV) +
  geom_sf(data = plot_locations_sp_HARV) +
  ggtitle("AOI Boundary Plot")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-10-plot-data-1.png" title="plot of chunk plot-data" alt="plot of chunk plot-data" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

When we plot the two layers together, `ggplot` sets the plot boundaries
so that they are large enough to include all of the data included in all of the layers.
That's really handy!

## Export a Shapefile

We can write an R spatial object to a shapefile using the `st_write` function
in `sf`. To do this we need the following arguments:

* the name of the spatial object (`plot_locations_sp_HARV`)
* the directory where we want to save our shapefile
           (to use `current = getwd()` or you can specify a different path)
* the name of the new shapefile  (`PlotLocations_HARV`)
* the driver which specifies the file format (ESRI Shapefile)

We can now export the spatial object as a shapefile.


~~~
st_write(plot_locations_sp_HARV,
         "data/PlotLocations_HARV.shp", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")
