We introduced multi-band raster data in
[an earlier lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/01-spatial-data-structures-formats/index.html). This episode explores how to import and plot
a multi-band raster in
R.

## Getting Started with Multi-Band Data in R

In this episode, the multi-band data that we are working with is imagery
collected using the
[NEON Airborne Observation Platform](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing)
high resolution camera over the
[NEON Harvard Forest field site](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV).
Each RGB image is a 3-band raster. The same steps would apply to
working with a multi-spectral image with 4 or more bands - like Landsat imagery.

If we read a RasterStack object into R using the `raster()` function, it only reads
in the first band.

```{r read-single-band}
RGB_band1_HARV <- raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")
```

We need to convert this data to a data frame in order to plot it with `ggplot`. 

```{r}
RGB_band1_HARV_df  <- as.data.frame(RGB_band1_HARV, xy = TRUE)
```

```{r harv-rgb-band1}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = RGB_band1_HARV_df,
              aes(x = x, y = y, alpha = HARV_RGB_Ortho)) + 
  coord_quickmap()
```

### Image Raster Data Values

As we saw in the previous exercise, this raster contains values between 0 and 255. These values
represent degrees of brightness associated with the image band. In
the case of a RGB image (red, green and blue), band 1 is the red band. When
we plot the red band, larger numbers (towards 255) represent pixels with more
red in them (a strong red reflection). Smaller numbers (towards 0) represent
pixels with less red in them (less red was reflected). To
plot an RGB image, we mix red + green + blue values into one single color to
create a full color image - similar to the color image a digital camera creates.

### Import A Specific Band

We can use the `raster()` function to import specific bands in our raster object
by specifying which band we want with `band = N` (N represents the band number we
want to work with). To import the green band, we would use `band = 2`.

```{r read-specific-band}
RGB_band2_HARV <-  raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif", band = 2)
```

We can convert this data to a data frame and plot the same way we plotted the red band: 

```{r}
RGB_band2_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(RGB_band2_HARV, xy = TRUE)
```

```{r rgb-harv-band2}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = RGB_band2_HARV_df,
              aes(x = x, y = y, alpha = HARV_RGB_Ortho)) + 
  coord_equal()
```

> ## Challenge: Making Sense of Single Band Images

> Compare the plots of band 1 (red) and band 2 (green). Is the forested area darker or lighter in band 2 (the green band) compared to band 1 (the red band)?
>
> > ## Solution

> > band 1 (red) because the leaves on trees of most often appear "green" -
> > healthy leaves reflect MORE green light than red light.

## Raster Stacks in R
Next, we will work with all three image bands (red, green and blue) as an R
RasterStack object. We will then plot a 3-band composite, or full color,
image.

To bring in all bands of a multi-band raster, we use the`stack()` function.

```{r intro-to-raster-stacks }
RGB_stack_HARV <- stack("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")
```

Let's preview the attributes of our stack object: 

```{r}
RGB_stack_HARV
```

We can view the attributes of each band in the stack in a single output: 

```{r}
RGB_stack_HARV@layers
```

If we have hundreds of bands, we can specify which band we'd like to view
attributes for using an index value: 

```{r}
RGB_stack_HARV[[2]]
```
We can also use the `ggplot` functions to plot the data in any layer
of our RasterStack object. Remember, we need to convert to a data
frame first. 
 
```{r}
RGB_stack_HARV_df  <- as.data.frame(RGB_stack_HARV, xy = TRUE)
```

Each band in our RasterStack gets its own column in the data frame. Thus we have: 

```{r}
str(RGB_stack_HARV_df)
```

Let's create a histogram of the first band: 

```{r rgb-harv-hist-band1}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = RGB_stack_HARV_df, aes(HARV_RGB_Ortho.1))
```

And a raster plot of the second band: 

```{r rgb-harv-plot-band2}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = RGB_stack_HARV_df,
              aes(x = x, y = y, alpha = HARV_RGB_Ortho.2)) + 
  coord_quickmap()
```

We can access any individual band in the same way.

### Create A Three Band Image
To render a final three band, colored image in R, we use the `plotRGB()` function.

This function allows us to:

1. Identify what bands we want to render in the red, green and blue regions. The
`plotRGB()` function defaults to a 1=red, 2=green, and 3=blue band order. However,
you can define what bands you'd like to plot manually. Manual definition of
bands is useful if you have, for example a near-infrared band and want to create
a color infrared image.
2. Adjust the `stretch` of the image to increase or decrease contrast.

Let's plot our 3-band image. Note that we can use the `plotRGB()`
function directly with our RasterStack object (we don't need a 
dataframe as this function isn't part of the `ggplot2` package).

```{r plot-rgb-image}
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3)
```

The image above looks pretty good. We can explore whether applying a stretch to
the image might improve clarity and contrast using `stretch="lin"` or
`stretch="hist"`.

![Image Stretch](../images/dc-spatial-raster/imageStretch_dark.jpg)

When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 0, a darker image is rendered by default. We can stretch 
the values to extend to the full 0-255 range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of the image.

![Image Stretch light](../images/dc-spatial-raster/imageStretch_light.jpg)

When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 255, a
lighter image is rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend to
the full 0-255 range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of
the image.


```{r plot-rbg-image-linear}
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        scale = 800,
        stretch = "lin")
```

```{r plot-rgb-image-hist}
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        scale = 800,
        stretch = "hist")
```

In this case, the stretch doesn't enhance the contrast our image significantly
given the distribution of reflectance (or brightness) values is distributed well
between 0 and 255.

## RasterStack vs RasterBrick in R

The R RasterStack and RasterBrick object types can both store multiple bands.
However, how they store each band is different. The bands in a RasterStack are
stored as links to raster data that is located somewhere on our computer. A
RasterBrick contains all of the objects stored within the actual R object.
In most cases, we can work with a RasterBrick in the same way we might work
with a RasterStack. However a RasterBrick is often more efficient and faster
to process - which is important when working with larger files.

> ## More Resources
>
> You can read the help for the `brick()` function by typing `?brick`.
{: .callout}

We can turn a RasterStack into a RasterBrick in R by using
`brick(StackName)`. Let's use the `object.size()` function to compare RasterStack and RasterBrick objects. First we will check
the size of our RasterStack object:

```{r raster-bricks }
object.size(RGB_stack_HARV)
```

Now we will create a RasterBrick object from our RasterStack data and view its size:

```{r}
RGB_brick_HARV <- brick(RGB_stack_HARV)

object.size(RGB_brick_HARV)
```

Notice that in the RasterBrick, all of the bands are stored within the actual
object. Thus, the RasterBrick object size is much larger than the
RasterStack object.

You use the `plotRGB()` function to plot a RasterBrick too:

```{r plot-brick}
plotRGB(RGB_brick_HARV)
```
