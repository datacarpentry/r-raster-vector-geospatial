Starting with this episode, we will be moving from working with raster
data to working with vector data. In this episode, we will open and plot point, line and polygon vector data
stored in shapefile format in R. These data refer to the [NEON Harvard Forest field site](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV), which we have been working with in previous
episodes. In later episodes, we will learn how to work with raster and
vector data together and combine them into a single plot.

## Import Shapefiles

We will use the `sf` package to work with vector data in R. Notice that the
`rgdal` package automatically loads when `sf` is loaded. We will also use the
`raster` package, which has been loaded in previous episodes, so we can explore raster and vector spatial metadata using similar commands. Make sure you have the `sf` library loaded. 

```{r load-sf, results='hide', eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(sf)
```

The shapefiles that we will import are:

* A polygon shapefile representing our field site boundary,
* A line shapefile representing roads, and
* A point shapefile representing the location of the [Fisher flux tower](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/flux-tower-measurements)
located at the [NEON Harvard Forest field site](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV).

The first shapefile that we will open contains the boundary of our study area
(or our Area Of Interest or AOI, hence the name `aoiBoundary`). To import
shapefiles we use the `sf` function `st_read()`. `st_read()` requires the file path to the shapefile.

Let's import our AOI:

```{r Import-Shapefile}
aoi_boundary_HARV <- st_read(
  "data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HarClip_UTMZ18.shp")
```

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes

When we import the `HarClip_UTMZ18` shapefile layer into R (as our
`aoi_boundary_HARV` object), the `st_read()` function automatically stores
information about the data. We are particularly interested in the geospatial
metadata, describing the format, CRS, extent, and other components of
the vector data, and the attributes which describe properties associated
with each individual vector object.

> and using attributes to subset and plot data.

## Spatial Metadata
Key metadata for all shapefiles include:

1. **Object Type:** the class of the imported object.
2. **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** the projection of the data.
3. **Extent:** the spatial extent (i.e. geographic area that the shapefile covers) of
the shapefile. Note that the spatial extent for a shapefile represents the combined
extent for all spatial objects in the shapefile.

We can view shapefile metadata using the `st_geometry_type()`, `st_crs()` and `st_bbox()` functions. First, let's view the
geometry type for our AOI shapefile: 

```{r}
st_geometry_type(aoi_boundary_HARV)
```

Our `aoi_boundary_HARV` is a polygon object. The 18 levels shown below
our output list the possible categories of the geometry type. 
Now let's check what CRS this file data is in:

```{r}
st_crs(aoi_boundary_HARV)
```

Our data in the CRS **UTM zone 18N**. The CRS is critical to 
interpreting the object's extent values as it specifies units. To find
the extent of our AOI, we can use the `st_bbox()` function: 

```{r}
st_bbox(aoi_boundary_HARV)
```

The spatial extent of a shapefile or R spatial object represents the geographic "edge" or location that is the furthest north, south east and west. Thus is represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object. Image Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).

Lastly, we can view all of the metadata and attributes for this shapefile object
by printing it to the screen:

```{r}
aoi_boundary_HARV
```

## Spatial Data Attributes
We introduced the idea of spatial data attributes in [an earlier lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/01-spatial-data-structures-formats/index.html). Now we will explore
how to use spatial data attributes stored in our data to plot
different features.

## Plot a Shapefile

Next, let's visualize the data in our `sf` object using the `ggplot`
package. Unlike with raster data, we do not need to convert vector
data to a dataframe before plotting with `ggplot`. 

We're going to customize our boundary plot by setting the 
size, color, and fill for our plot. When plotting `sf` objects with `ggplot2`, you need to use the `coord_sf()` coordinate system.

```{r plot-shapefile}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, size = 3, color = "black", fill = "cyan1") + 
  ggtitle("AOI Boundary Plot") + 
  coord_sf()
```
