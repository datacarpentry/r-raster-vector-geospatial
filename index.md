The tutorials in this series cover how to open, work with and plot vector and raster-format spatial data in R. Additional topics include working with spatial metadata (extent and coordinate reference systems), reprojecting spatial data, and working with raster time series data.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Data Carpentry’s teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow. These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools, but working through this lesson requires working copies of the software described below. To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download the data and install everything before working through this lesson. Installation instructions can be found on the [workshop homepage](http://www.datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/setup.html).
