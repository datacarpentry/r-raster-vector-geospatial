The episodes in this lesson cover how to open, work with, and plot
vector and raster-format spatial data in R. Additional topics include
working with spatial metadata (extent and coordinate reference systems), 
reprojecting spatial data, and working with raster time series data.

> ## Prerequisites
> Data Carpentry’s teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged 
> to use their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an 
> efficient workflow. To most effectively use these materials, please 
> make sure to download the data and install everything before
> working through this lesson. 
> 
> ### R Skill Level
> This lesson assumes you have some knowledge of `R`. If you've never 
> used `R` before, or need a refresher, start with our
> [Introduction to R for Geospatial Data](http://www.datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/)
> lesson.
