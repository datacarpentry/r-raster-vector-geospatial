## Things You'll Need To Complete This Episode

See the [lesson homepage](.) for detailed information about the software, data,
and other prerequisites you will need to work through the examples in this
episode.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This episode will review how to import spatial points stored in `.csv` (Comma
Separated Value) format into R as an `sf` spatial object. We will also
reproject data imported from an ESRI `shapefile` format, export the reprojected data as an ESRI `shapefile`, and plot raster and vector data as layers in the same plot.

## Spatial Data in Text Format

The `HARV_PlotLocations.csv` file contains `x, y` (point) locations for study
plot where NEON collects data on
[vegetation and other ecological metics](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/terrestrial-organismal-sampling).
We would like to:

- Create a map of these plot locations.
- Export the data in an ESRI `shapefile` format to share with our colleagues. This
  `shapefile` can be imported into most GIS software.
- Create a map showing vegetation height with plot locations layered on top.

Spatial data are sometimes stored in a text file format (`.txt` or `.csv`). If
the text file has an associated `x` and `y` location column, then we can
convert it into an `sf` spatial object. The `sf` object allows us to store both
the `x,y` values that represent the coordinate location of each point and the
associated attribute data - or columns describing each feature in the spatial
object.

We will continue using the `sf` and `terra` packages in this episode.

## Import .csv

To begin let's import a `.csv` file that contains plot coordinate `x, y`
locations at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site (`HARV_PlotLocations.csv`) and
look at the structure of that new object:


``` r
plot_locations_HARV <-
  read.csv("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARV_PlotLocations.csv")

str(plot_locations_HARV)
```

``` output
'data.frame':	21 obs. of  16 variables:
 $ easting   : num  731405 731934 731754 731724 732125 ...
 $ northing  : num  4713456 4713415 4713115 4713595 4713846 ...
 $ geodeticDa: chr  "WGS84" "WGS84" "WGS84" "WGS84" ...
 $ utmZone   : chr  "18N" "18N" "18N" "18N" ...
 $ plotID    : chr  "HARV_015" "HARV_033" "HARV_034" "HARV_035" ...
 $ stateProvi: chr  "MA" "MA" "MA" "MA" ...
 $ county    : chr  "Worcester" "Worcester" "Worcester" "Worcester" ...
 $ domainName: chr  "Northeast" "Northeast" "Northeast" "Northeast" ...
 $ domainID  : chr  "D01" "D01" "D01" "D01" ...
 $ siteID    : chr  "HARV" "HARV" "HARV" "HARV" ...
 $ plotType  : chr  "distributed" "tower" "tower" "tower" ...
 $ subtype   : chr  "basePlot" "basePlot" "basePlot" "basePlot" ...
 $ plotSize  : int  1600 1600 1600 1600 1600 1600 1600 1600 1600 1600 ...
 $ elevation : num  332 342 348 334 353 ...
 $ soilTypeOr: chr  "Inceptisols" "Inceptisols" "Inceptisols" "Histosols" ...
 $ plotdim_m : int  40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 ...
```

We now have a data frame that contains 21 locations (rows) and 16 variables
(attributes). Note that all of our character data was imported into R as
character (text) data. Next, let's explore the dataframe to determine whether
it contains columns with coordinate values. If we are lucky, our `.csv` will
contain columns labeled:

- "X" and "Y" OR
- Latitude and Longitude OR
- easting and northing (UTM coordinates)

Let's check out the column names of our dataframe.


``` r
names(plot_locations_HARV)
```

``` output
 [1] "easting"    "northing"   "geodeticDa" "utmZone"    "plotID"    
 [6] "stateProvi" "county"     "domainName" "domainID"   "siteID"    
[11] "plotType"   "subtype"    "plotSize"   "elevation"  "soilTypeOr"
[16] "plotdim_m" 
```

## Identify X,Y Location Columns

Our column names include several fields that might contain spatial information.
The `plot_locations_HARV$easting` and `plot_locations_HARV$northing` columns
contain coordinate values. We can confirm this by looking at the first six rows
of our data.


``` r
head(plot_locations_HARV$easting)
```

``` output
[1] 731405.3 731934.3 731754.3 731724.3 732125.3 731634.3
```

``` r
head(plot_locations_HARV$northing)
```

``` output
[1] 4713456 4713415 4713115 4713595 4713846 4713295
```

We have coordinate values in our data frame. In order to convert our data frame
to an `sf` object, we also need to know the CRS associated with those
coordinate values.

There are several ways to figure out the CRS of spatial data in text format.

1. We can check the file metadata in hopes that the CRS was recorded in the
  data.
2. We can explore the file itself to see if CRS information is embedded in the
  file header or somewhere in the data columns.

Following the `easting` and `northing` columns, there is a `geodeticDa` and a
`utmZone` column. These appear to contain CRS information (`datum` and
`projection`). Let's view those next.


``` r
head(plot_locations_HARV$geodeticDa)
```

``` output
[1] "WGS84" "WGS84" "WGS84" "WGS84" "WGS84" "WGS84"
```

``` r
head(plot_locations_HARV$utmZone)
```

``` output
[1] "18N" "18N" "18N" "18N" "18N" "18N"
```

It is not typical to store CRS information in a column. But this particular
file contains CRS information this way. The `geodeticDa` and `utmZone` columns
contain the information that helps us determine the CRS:

- `geodeticDa`: WGS84  -- this is geodetic datum WGS84
- `utmZone`: 18

In
[When Vector Data Don't Line Up - Handling Spatial Projection \& CRS in R](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/09-vector-when-data-dont-line-up-crs)
we learned about the components of a `proj4` string. We have everything we need
to assign a CRS to our data frame.

To create the `proj4` associated with UTM Zone 18 WGS84 we can look up the
projection on the
[Spatial Reference website](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/32618/),
which contains a list of CRS formats for each projection. From here, we can
extract the
[proj4 string for UTM Zone 18N WGS84](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/32618/proj4.txt).

However, if we have other data in the UTM Zone 18N projection, it's much easier
to use the `st_crs()` function to extract the CRS in `proj4` format from that
object and assign it to our new spatial object. We've seen this CRS before with
our Harvard Forest study site (`point_HARV`).


``` r
st_crs(point_HARV)
```

``` output
Coordinate Reference System:

        PARAMETER["Longitude of natural origin",-75,
            ANGLEUNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433],
            ID["EPSG",8802]],
        PARAMETER["Scale factor at natural origin",0.9996,
            SCALEUNIT["unity",1],
            ID["EPSG",8805]],
        PARAMETER["False easting",500000,
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1],
            ID["EPSG",8806]],
        PARAMETER["False northing",0,
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1],
            ID["EPSG",8807]]],
    CS[Cartesian,2],
        AXIS["(E)",east,
            ORDER[1],
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]],
        AXIS["(N)",north,
            ORDER[2],
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]],
    ID["EPSG",32618]]
```

The output above shows that the points vector layer is in UTM zone 18N. We can
thus use the CRS from that spatial object to convert our non-spatial dataframe
into an `sf` object.

Next, let's create a `crs` object that we can use to define the CRS of our `sf`
object when we create it.


``` r
utm18nCRS <- st_crs(point_HARV)
utm18nCRS
```

``` output

                LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]]],
        PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
            ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],

        PARAMETER["Longitude of natural origin",-75,
            ANGLEUNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433],
            ID["EPSG",8802]],
        PARAMETER["Scale factor at natural origin",0.9996,
            SCALEUNIT["unity",1],
            ID["EPSG",8805]],
        PARAMETER["False easting",500000,
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1],
            ID["EPSG",8806]],
        PARAMETER["False northing",0,
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1],

        AXIS["(N)",north,
            ORDER[2],
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]],
    ID["EPSG",32618]]
```

``` r
class(utm18nCRS)
```

``` output
[1] "crs"
```

## .csv to sf object

Next, let's convert our dataframe into an `sf` object. To do this, we need to
specify:

1. The columns containing X (`easting`) and Y (`northing`) coordinate values
2. The CRS that the column coordinate represent (units are included in the CRS) - stored in our `utmCRS` object.

We will use the `st_as_sf()` function to perform the conversion.


``` r
plot_locations_sp_HARV <- st_as_sf(plot_locations_HARV,
                                   coords = c("easting", "northing"),
                                   crs = utm18nCRS)
```

We should double check the CRS to make sure it is correct.


``` r
st_crs(plot_locations_sp_HARV)
```

``` output

        PARAMETER["Longitude of natural origin",-75,

            ID["EPSG",8806]],
        PARAMETER["False northing",0,
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1],

        AXIS["(E)",east,
            ORDER[1],
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]],
        AXIS["(N)",north,
            ORDER[2],
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]],
    ID["EPSG",32618]]
```

## Plot Spatial Object

We now have a spatial R object, we can plot our newly created spatial object.


``` r
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = plot_locations_sp_HARV) +
  ggtitle("Map of Plot Locations")
```

<img src="fig/10-vector-csv-to-shapefile-in-r-rendered-plot-data-points-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Plot Extent

In
[Open and Plot Vector Layers in R](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/06-vector-open-shapefile-in-r)
we learned about spatial object extent. When we plot several spatial layers in
R using `ggplot`, all of the layers of the plot are considered in setting the
boundaries of the plot. To show this, let's plot our `aoi_boundary_HARV` object
with our vegetation plots.


``` r
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV) +
  geom_sf(data = plot_locations_sp_HARV) +
  ggtitle("AOI Boundary Plot")
```

<img src="fig/10-vector-csv-to-shapefile-in-r-rendered-plot-data-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

When we plot the two layers together, `ggplot` sets the plot boundaries so that
they are large enough to include all of the data included in all of the layers.
That's really handy!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge - Import \& Plot Additional Points

We want to add two phenology plots to our existing map of vegetation plot
locations.

Import the .csv: `HARV/HARV_2NewPhenPlots.csv` into R and do the following:

1. Find the X and Y coordinate locations. Which value is X and which value is
   Y?
2. These data were collected in a geographic coordinate system (WGS84). Convert
  the dataframe into an `sf` object.
3. Plot the new points with the plot location points from above. Be sure to add
  a legend. Use a different symbol for the 2 new points!

If you have extra time, feel free to add roads and other layers to your map!

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Answers

1)
First we will read in the new csv file and look at the data structure.


``` r
newplot_locations_HARV <-
  read.csv("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARV_2NewPhenPlots.csv")
str(newplot_locations_HARV)
```

``` output
'data.frame':	2 obs. of  13 variables:
 $ decimalLat: num  42.5 42.5
 $ decimalLon: num  -72.2 -72.2
 $ country   : chr  "unitedStates" "unitedStates"
 $ stateProvi: chr  "MA" "MA"
 $ county    : chr  "Worcester" "Worcester"
 $ domainName: chr  "Northeast" "Northeast"
 $ domainID  : chr  "D01" "D01"
 $ siteID    : chr  "HARV" "HARV"
 $ plotType  : chr  "tower" "tower"
 $ subtype   : chr  "phenology" "phenology"
 $ plotSize  : int  40000 40000
 $ plotDimens: chr  "200m x 200m" "200m x 200m"
 $ elevation : num  358 346
```

2)
The US boundary data we worked with previously is in a geographic WGS84 CRS. We
can use that data to establish a CRS for this data. First we will extract the
CRS from the `country_boundary_US` object and confirm that it is WGS84.


``` r
geogCRS <- st_crs(country_boundary_US)
geogCRS
```

``` output
Coordinate Reference System:
  User input: WGS 84 
  wkt:
GEOGCRS["WGS 84",
    DATUM["World Geodetic System 1984",
        ELLIPSOID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]]],
    PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
        ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
    CS[ellipsoidal,2],
        AXIS["latitude",north,
            ORDER[1],
            ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
        AXIS["longitude",east,
            ORDER[2],
            ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
    ID["EPSG",4326]]
```

Then we will convert our new data to a spatial dataframe, using the `geogCRS`
object as our CRS.


``` r
newPlot.Sp.HARV <- st_as_sf(newplot_locations_HARV,
                            coords = c("decimalLon", "decimalLat"),
                            crs = geogCRS)
```

Next we'll confirm that the CRS for our new object is correct.


``` r
st_crs(newPlot.Sp.HARV)
```

``` output
Coordinate Reference System:
  User input: WGS 84 
  wkt:
GEOGCRS["WGS 84",
    DATUM["World Geodetic System 1984",
        ELLIPSOID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]]],
    PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
        ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
    CS[ellipsoidal,2],
        AXIS["latitude",north,
            ORDER[1],
            ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
        AXIS["longitude",east,
            ORDER[2],
            ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
    ID["EPSG",4326]]
```

We will be adding these new data points to the plot we created before. The data
for the earlier plot was in UTM. Since we're using `ggplot`, it will reproject
the data for us.

3) Now we can create our plot.


``` r
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = plot_locations_sp_HARV, color = "orange") +
  geom_sf(data = newPlot.Sp.HARV, color = "lightblue") +
  ggtitle("Map of All Plot Locations")
```

## Export to an ESRI `shapefile`

We can write an R spatial object to an ESRI `shapefile` using the `st_write` function
in `sf`. To do this we need the following arguments:

- the name of the spatial object (`plot_locations_sp_HARV`)
- the directory where we want to save our ESRI `shapefile` (to use `current = getwd()`
  or you can specify a different path)
- the name of the new ESRI `shapefile` (`PlotLocations_HARV`)
- the driver which specifies the file format (ESRI Shapefile)

We can now export the spatial object as an ESRI `shapefile`.


``` r
st_write(plot_locations_sp_HARV,
         "data/PlotLocations_HARV.shp", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")
```



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Know the projection (if any) of your point data prior to converting to a
  spatial object.
- Convert a data frame to an `sf` object using the `st_as_sf()` function.
- Export an `sf` object as text using the `st_write()` function.
