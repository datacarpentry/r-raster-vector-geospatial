##About
This activity will walk you through the fundamental principles of working 
with raster data in R.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

<div id="objectives">

<h3>Goals / Objectives</h3>
After completing this activity, you will know:
<ol>
<li>What a raster dataset is and its fundamental attributes.</li>
<li>How to import rasters into `R` using the raster library.</li>
<li>How to perform raster calculations in `R`.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Things You'll Need To Complete This Lesson</h3>

<h3>R Libraries to Install:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>raster:</strong> <code> install.packages("raster")</code></li>
<li><strong>rgdal:</strong> <code> install.packages("rgdal")</code></li>

</ul>
<h4>Tools To Install</h4>

Please be sure you have the most current version of `R` and preferably
R studio to write your code.


<h4>Data to Download</h4>

Download the raster and *in situ* collected vegetation structure data:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://neonhighered.org/Data/LidarActivity/CHM_InSitu_Data.zip" class="btn btn-success"> DOWNLOAD Sample NEON LiDAR data in Raster Format & Vegetation Sampling Data</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/rasterLayers_tif.zip" class="btn btn-success"> DOWNLOAD NEON imagery data (tiff format) California Domain 17 (D17)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The LiDAR and imagery data used to create the rasters in this dataset were 
collected over the San Joaquin field site located in California (NEON Domain 17) 
and processed at <a href="http://www.neoninc.org" target="_blank" >NEON </a> 
headquarters. The entire dataset can be accessed by request from the NEON website.</p>  

<h4>Recommended Pre-Lesson Reading</h4>

#About Raster Data
Raster or "gridded" data are data that are saved in pixels. In the spatial world, 
each pixel represents an area on the Earth's surface. For example in the raster 
below, each pixel represents a particular land cover class that would be found in 
that location in the real world.
